This file describes the concept of experience points and perks in Cosmodog.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Killing an enemy gives the player experience points (XP). They depend exclusively on the type of enemy.

XP can be used to obtain various perks. Perks are abilities that allow the player easier progressing through the game.

Previously, the progression of the player has been implemented exclusively through tools that had to be found in the game world. 
This posed some challenges with the introduction of perks: What is the difference between tools and perks? 
What should be the various new abilities when the gameplay is already balanced as is?

Now, both perks and tools are abilities in different categories. Both are shown in the same screen. 
While tool based abilities are acquired by finding tools in any order, perks are bound to the perk tree and build up on each other.
Additionally, each of the perk abilities has its cost in experience points.

Instead of adding new abilities, which would break the game balance, gameplay features previously existing from the start on are depending on perks now.
That makes the game more difficult at the beginning and extends the play timer at costs of some frustration in the early phase. 
Killing enemies is the only way to bring the players to the point where their character is as powerful as in the previous version of the game.
