Let me introduce you Cosmodog.

Cosmodog is the main character of an old cartoon series.
A brave talking dog in a red space suit, with a big bubble helmet around his head.
Cosmodog is an adventurer, a pioneer, a discoverer. He is the hero of a whole generation of kids.

But it all does not matter. 

For me, Cosmodog is a symbol. A symbol of time long gone.
Of love which is lost. Of dreams that never came true. Of beliefs that were false.

Cosmodog is a name that brings back painful memories.
A name that I desperately tried to forget. A name that I cursed many times.

But despite pain, doubts and dismay, this name is a beacon which shines in the dimming,
starless world of broken ideals and shattered principles,
illuminating the never ending path to my true identity.

It is also the name of my spaceship.
