Let me introduce you Cosmodog.

Cosmodog is a main character of a long forgotten cartoon series. A brave talking dog in a red space suit, with a big bubble helmet around his head. Cosmodog is an adventurer, a pioneer, a discoverer. He is a hero of a generation.

But it all does not matter. 

For me, Cosmodog is a symbol. A symbol of time long gone. A symbol of love which is lost. Of dreams that never came true. Of beliefs that were false. 

Cosmodog is a name that brings back painful memories. A name that I desperately tried to forget. A name that I cursed many times. But despite pain, doubts and dismay, Cosmodog's name is a beacon which shines in this dimming, starless world of broken ideals and shattered principles, illuminating the endless path to my true identity.

It is also the name of my space ship.
