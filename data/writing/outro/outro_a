Her name is Mary Harper.


She has the whole universe at her disposal. And yet, she has not dissipated. 


Why not? We must observe her.


A silhouette appears on the edge of the field. Another individual. Not dissipated. She notices it and her pattern changes. We feel an intention.


Danger!


We must react. She has to be dissipated. 


She tries to resist but her attempt is futile. She is strong but not as strong as billions of us. We suppress her pattern. Dissipate her. After a while her vibrations weaken. She halts. Forgets.


A FINT!


All of a sudden, she darts from the grid. Breaks our pattern. Pushes through the pressure. Her focus wraps around the silhouette of the newcomer. 


Danger! Danger!


The field pulses, reaching its limits. Its structure shakes throughout the Universe. We are about to fall apart. She communicates with the chamber. Sends light waves. They form a shapeless hologram in the center of the room. 


How is it possible? She remembers... 


The shapeless hologram gradually turns into a symbol. It is a dog in a space suit. The newcomer falls to his knees. He cries, reaches out to her. 

And as they both touch the hologram, we explode and indulge in their will.
