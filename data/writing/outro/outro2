Outro 2
---------------------------------------------------------------
A FINT! All of a sudden, she is darting from the grid. Breaking the pattern. Pushing through the pressure. The vibration is distorting the field. Her focus is wrapping around the silhouette which is reaching the main chamber of the maze. Danger! Danger!


The field is pulsing, reaching its limits. Conceptual structure is shaking through the universe. We are about to fall apart. She is communicating with the chamber. Sending light waves. They are being formed out of nothing, building a shapeless hologram in the center of the room. She is remembering. 


The shape is turning into a symbol of a life form. It is a dog in a space suit. It is known to her. It is known to the man in the chamber. She is pulsing and vibrating while the man is falling to his knees. The name of the toy is known to her, but she does not remember yet. The man is reaching out to her. She is maintaining the hologram with all available resources. We will be torn apart very soon. The man in the chamber is struggling and crying. She is holding still for a second and then she implodes and we indulge in her will.
