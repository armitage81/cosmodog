She has the whole universe at her disposal. All knowledge of the world. She moves through time and space, collecting and shaping, constructing and describing. She is restless. She is driven. A complex node of personality that bends the field to her will. Not united. Problematic. A variable. Target of inspection.


A relevant information is in the field. A silhouette on the horizon. A lone person. Her pattern is losing the regularity. Processing the data. Waves are vibrating through the fields nodes. Reflections of light. The silhouette is entering an old structure. A maze of failed resistance. Her vibrations in the field are growing in frequency. An intention. Danger. We need to react. We have to suppress the irregularity. Strong personality. But not as strong as combination of billions. Vibrations are scaling down. Fight of concepts. She is giving in. Losing the focus on the newly arrived. Inspection of her has less priority than the continuance of the field. She needs to be dissolved. She is resisting. Futile attempt. We're pressing. More difficult than expected. But successful. The vibration is stopping. She is falling back to the regular pattern. Losing focus. Starting to dissolve. Accepting concepts. Forgetting.
