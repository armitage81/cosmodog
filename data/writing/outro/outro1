--------------------------------------------------
She has the whole universe at her disposal. All knowledge of the world. She is moving through time and space, collecting and shaping, constructing and describing. She is restless. She is driven. A complex personality node, bending the field to her will. Not dissipated. Problematic. A variable. Target of inspection.


A relevant information is pervading the field. A silhouette on the horizon. A lone person. She is noticing it. Her pattern is losing the regularity. Processing the data. Waves are vibrating through the field's nodes. Reflections of light. The silhouette is entering an old structure. A maze of failed resistance. Her vibrations in the field are growing in frequency. An intention. Danger. We need to react. We have to suppress the irregularity. Strong personality. But not as strong as combination of billions. Her vibrations are scaling down. Fight of concepts. She is giving in. Losing the focus. Inspection of her has less priority than the continuance of the field. She needs to be dissipated. 


She is resisting. Futile attempt. We're pressing. More difficult than expected. But successful. The vibration is stopping. She is falling back to the regular pattern. Losing focus. Starting to dissipate. Accepting concepts. Forgetting.
