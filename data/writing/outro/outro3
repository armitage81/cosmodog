--------------------------------------------------------------
There is no meaning in life, that is an objective truth. She was born and she will die for no particular reason. Compassion and altruism are dictated by natural selection which killed all who were not fit enough for this world. There is no objective reason for love. Ideals and passions do not matter on the grand scale of the universe. 


But she learned that objectivity is not that important. Not to her, at least. She is human. She feels and functions as a human would feel and function. She has to play by the rules which made her. Subjectively, her life is the most important thing in the universe. Subjectively, her ideals are sacred. Subjectively, her love is immortal.


She feels warmth and sees light. She perceives the space around her. She hears sounds of the ambience. She has a vague memory at the corner of her mind.


She inclines her head and sees the toy in her hands. It is a dog in a red space suit and a big transparent helmet. It is important. It is the most important thing in her life... in my life.
