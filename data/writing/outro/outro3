--------------------------------------------------------------
There is no meaning in life, that is an objective truth. She was born and she will die for no particular reason. Compassion and altruism are dictated by natural selection which killed all who were not fit enough for her world. There is no objective reason for love. Ideals and passions do not matter in the grand scheme of the universe. 


But she could not care less now.


She learned that objectivity is not important. Not to her, at least. She is human. She feels and functions as a human. She plays by the rules which made her. Subjectively, her life is the most important thing in the universe. Subjectively, her ideals are sacred. Subjectively, her love is immortal.


She feels the warmth and sees the light. She perceives the space around her. She hears the sounds of the ambience. A hospital.


She has a vague memory at the corner of her mind.


She inclines her head and sees the toy in her hands. It is a dog in a red space suit and a big transparent helmet. It is important. It is the most important thing in her life... In my life.
