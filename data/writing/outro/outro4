I feel the warmth of a tear on my cheek. The memory comes closer. The voices do not distort my mind any more. I struggle to open my mouth. My members are weak, but I manage to lift the toy with my hands. Undefined memories are flashing through my head - stars, fresh grass, an arm under my head. The toy. The dog. What was his name?


My lips are dry. I take a deep breath. The dog is grinning in my face. And then I remember everything. And with the ultimate relief I whisper to the Universe.


"Cosmodog"
