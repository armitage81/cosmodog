The moment the missile hit your ship and tore its hull apart you had a vision of her again.


The room was lit. White panels. Flowers in vases. The nurses attended their business. Talked quietly. Pretended not to listen.


She sat in a wheel chair, looking at you. Through you. No recognition in her eyes. She wore a cyan overall. Slippers. In her hands - a toy dog in a red space suit. The cosmodog.
You brought it hoping it will trigger something. A memory. A sign of awareness. But she just sat there, unreachable like she always was.


How to call your relationship? A riddle you never solved despite trying hard for a long time. 
A romance would imply an interest for your person to her that you could not claim for yourself. Not after what happened. On the other hand, it took too long for a mere affair. 
And for sure, it wasn't just friendship. Not for you, that is.
