Intro
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The missile hits your space freighter like a giant hammer. The ship shakes. You curse.


Idiot! What were you thinking?! The planet is off-limits!


You try the controls, to no avail.


<font:speech> "Luke, status!" <font:narration>


Luke's computer voice is as calm as always. <font:speech> "I recommend an immediate evacuation, sir." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No kidding!" <font:narration>
You hastily put the assistant device on your wrist. <font:speech> "Transfer yourself, we're leaving!" <font:narration>


The aisle to the escape pod is filled with acrid smoke. The ship is on fire.


Luke reports again, this time from the device on your wrist.


<font:speech> "Copy process finished," <font:narration> he says.
<font:speech> "Your vital signs are good, except for the high heart rate. Applying medicine..." <font:narration>


A needle protrudes from the device and pierces the skin on your backhand.


<font:speech> "I'm getting thrilled way too easily," <font:narration> you mutter wryly, hurrying toward the heck.


Passing a monitor, you see the green surface of Phaeton on it. The planet is growing fast. You don't have much time.


<font:speech> "Opening the pod," <font:narration> Luke says indifferently.
A door slides aside. Behind it is a small cabin with two seats and a console.


<font:speech> "Enter the location's coordinates," <font:narration> you command, placing yourself in one of the seats.
The door snaps shut.


<font:speech> "Done." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Launch!" <font:narration>


A blast jams you into the seat.
The spherical pod parts from the ship and swirls through space like a huge tennis ball until the nozzles stabilize its trajectory.


Lightness overcomes you. You draw breath and blink away the sweat from your eye lids. It floats in front of your face, weightless.


<font:speech> "Preparing the emergency landing," <font:narration> Luke reports.


You exhale and try to calm down. There is still a chance.


Or is there? An alert message appears on the monitor in front of you.


<font:speech> "A lock on!" <font:narration> you whisper.


It seems, the guardian satellite came back to finish the job.


You brace for impact...


...but it never comes.


What is going on?


<font:speech> "Something is jamming the satellite's target systems, sir." <font:narration>


Luke's voice is still annoyingly calm and emotionless.


Another message appears on the monitor: <font:speech> "You're welcome. Take care. God protects the wary ones."


<font:narration> You raise your eyebrows. What the hell is this supposed to mean? Never mind, thank you, anyway, whoever you are.


A sequence of harsh thrusts adjusts the orbit of the pod. The vessel switches to the controlled landing trajectory.


You fall...
