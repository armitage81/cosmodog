Intro
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The missile hits your freighter with immense impact. Total damage. You curse. 


What were you thinking?! The planet is off-limits!


<font:speech> "Luke, status!" <font:narration> 


Luke's computer voice coming from above is calm as always. <font:speech> "I recommend an immediate evacuation, sir." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No kidding!" <font:narration> You put the assistant device on your wrist. <font:speech> "Transfer yourself, Luke, we're leaving." <font:narration>


You smell acrid smoke. The ship is on fire! 


You squeeze yourself through the narrow gap towards the port side, passing squeaking air wells and toppled crates. Luke reports again, this time from the device on your wrist. 


<font:speech> "Copy process finished," <font:narration> he says. <font:speech> "Your vital signs are good, except for the high heart rate. Applying medicine." <font:narration>


A needle protrudes from the device and pierces the skin on your backhand.


<font:speech> "I'm getting thrilled way too easily," <font:narration> you gasp wryly. 


Passing a monitor, you see the green surface of Phaeton on it. It is growing fast. You don't have much time. 


The escape pod flickers with red and blue emergency lights.


<font:speech> "Opening the pod," <font:narration> Luke says indifferently. The door slides aside. Behind it is a claustrophobically small cabin with two seats and a console.


<font:speech> "Enter the location's coordinates," <font:narration> you command, placing yourself in one of the seats and fastening the belt.


<font:speech> "Done." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Launch!" <font:narration>


The door snaps shut. The launch blast jams you into the seat like a giant hammer. The spherical pod parts from the ship and swirls through the vacuum like a huge tennis ball. Then the nozzles stabilize its trajectory. 


Lightness overcomes you. You draw breath and blink away the sweat from your eye lids. It floats in front of your face, weightless.


<font:speech> "Captain, Cosmodog is gone. Preparing the emergency landing." <font:narration>


You exhale and try to calm down. 


An alert message appears on the monitor in front of you. Your heart skips a beat. 


<font:speech> "A lock on!" <font:narration> you whisper.


Apparently, the destruction of the ship was not enough for the guardian satellite. It came back to finish the job.


You close your eyes and brace for impact...


But it never comes.


Not after a second. 


Not after ten. 


You anxiously listen to the silence, wondering what is going on.


<font:speech> "Something is jamming the satellite's target systems, sir." <font:narration> 


Luke's voice is still annoyingly calm and emotionless.


A message appears on the monitor: <font:speech> "You're welcome. Take care. God protects the wary ones." 


<font:narration> What the hell is this supposed to mean?


Luke initiates the emergency landing procedure. A sequence of harsh thrusts adjusts the orbit of the pod. The vessel switches to the controlled landing trajectory. 


You fall...
