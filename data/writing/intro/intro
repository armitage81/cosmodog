Intro
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ship rumbles as the missile impacts its stern. The howling fire alarm hurts your ears. You curse. The guardian satellite did a good job. The ship is out of control. 


What were you thinking?! The planet is off-limits!


<font:speech> "Luke, status!" <font:narration> 


Luke's computer voice coming from above is his usual calm baritone as he reports the impending destruction of the space ship. <font:speech> "I recommend an immediate evacuation, sir." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No kidding!" <font:narration> you growl while you strap on the assistant device to your wrist. <font:speech> "Transfer yourself, Luke, we're leaving." <font:narration>


You smell acrid smoke. The ship is on fire! Luckily, the aisle to the escape pod is still accessible. 


You squeeze yourself through the narrow gap towards the port side, passing squeaking air wells and toppled crates. Luke reports again, this time from the device on your wrist. 


<font:speech> "Copy process finished," <font:narration> he says. <font:speech> "Your vital signs are good, except for the high heart rate. Applying medicine." <font:narration>


A needle pierces the skin on your backhand.


<font:speech> "I'm getting thrilled way too easily," <font:narration> you gasp wryly. 


Passing a monitor, you see the green surface of Phaeton on it. It is growing fast. The strident alarm sound howls through the corridors like the ship's last cry. You don't have much time. 


The escape pod flickers with red and blue emergency lights.


<font:speech> "Opening the pod," <font:narration> Luke says indifferently. The door slides aside. Behind it is a claustrophobically small cabin with two seats and a console.


<font:speech> "Enter the location's coordinates," <font:narration> you command, placing yourself in one of the seats and fastening the belt.


<font:speech> "Done." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Launch!" <font:narration>


The door snaps shut, suppressing the wailing fire alarm from outside. Silence. The soft foam rubber interior of the cabin gives you a short-living illusion of comfort. It is destroyed within a moment, when the acceleration of the launch blast jams you into the seat like a giant hammer. The spherical pod parts from the ship and swirls through the vacuum like a huge tennis ball. Then the nozzles stabilize its trajectory. 


Lightness overcomes you. You draw breath and blink away the sweat from your eye lids. It floats in front of your face, weightless.


<font:speech> "Captain, the damage to the ship is irreversible. Cosmodog is gone. Leaving the planet will not be possible." <font:narration>


You exhale and try to calm down. 


<font:speech> "Not with this attitude, Luke." <font:narration> 


An alert message appears on the monitor in front of you, coloring the inside of the cabin in a demonic red tinge. Your heart skips a beat. 


<font:speech> "A lock on!" <font:narration> you whisper.


Apparently, the destruction of the ship was not enough for the guardian. 


You close your eyes and brace for impact...


But it never comes.


Not after a second. 


Not after ten. 


You anxiously listen to the silence, wondering what is going on.


<font:speech> "Intercepting a command transmission to the guardian satellite." <font:narration> 


Luke's voice is still annoyingly calm and emotionless. 


<font:speech> "Something is taking control over the satellite's weapon systems. There is a comment message. It says: AN EMERGENCY POD. POSSIBLE SURVIVORS. GOD PROTECTS THE WARY." <font:narration>


What is this supposed to mean?


The alert message disappears. At the same time Luke reports, <font:speech> "Lock on removed. The guardian satellite has been deactivated." <font:narration>


You open your eyes. That was close.


The landing procedure is being initiated. A sequence of harsh nozzle thrusts adjusts the orbit of the pod. The vessel switches to the controlled landing trajectory. 


You fall...
