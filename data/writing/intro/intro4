Marys helplessness and that of yours drove you crazy. You started reading about her research. Spoke with her colleagues. Inspected recent news from Phaeton. Your investigation led you to a surprising conclusion. Mary didn't have an accident. Her condition was a result of a voluntary action. She was behind something big. Abandoned by her previous supporters at AIV she continued the researche on her own. Flew to Phaeton. Must have found something there. 


At your seventh night in the hospital you had a dream. A sunset on an alien world. A big red structure standing out on the horizon, throwing a long shadow over the plain field. And Marys voice calling your name.
It might have been the torturing feeling of uselessness and helplessness that triggered the idea in your mind. Mary was still out there. She waited for you on Phaeton. You would go there and find her. Join her.
