You smell smoke and carbon dioxide that had leaked into the pilot cabin from the burning stern before the firewalls locked down. Luckily, the aisle to the escape pod is still accessible. You squeeze yourself through the narrow gap towards the port side, passing squeaking air wells and toppled crates. Luke reports again, this time from the device on your wrist. "Copy process finished," he says. "Your vital signs are good, except for the high heart rate. Applying medicine." A needle pierces the skin on your backhand.


"I'm getting thrilled too easily," you gasp wryly. Passing the monitor view, you see the green surface of Phaeton growing visibly on its screen. The strident alarm sound howls through the corridors like the ship's last cry. You don't have much time. 


The escape pod flickers with red and blue emergency lights.
