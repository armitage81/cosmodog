Your paths diverged five years ago. She went back to the Archeological Institute of Vera and continued her mind-bending research while you kept doing what you always did. Flying people and stuff through space.
She sent an elegant and thoughtful farewell letter. Explained that there were much more important things than you. You agreed with her reasoning. You always did.


She finished her work, became famous. You haven't met, but she was always there with you. You thought of her every day of the last five years. And then you got a call from the Institute.


Mary was found by security drones on Lydia, the northern continent of Phaeton, in the infamous valley around Lydport. Unconscious. Dehydrated. Demented. On behalf of the rector of AIV, the Fleet organized her evacuation.
She was brought to the hospital on Vera. The rector asked you to pay a visit. You came with the next possible jump window.
