You smell smoke and carbon dioxide that leaked into the pilot cabin from the burning stern before the firewalls locked it down. Luckily, the aisle to the escape pod is still accessible. You squeeze yourself through the narrow gap toward the portside, passing ventilation pipes and toppled crates. Luke reports again, this time from the device on your wrist. "Copy process finished," he says. "Your vital signs are good except of the high heart rate. Adjusting adrenaline." A needle pierces the skin on your backhand.


"I'm getting thrilled too easily," you gasp wryly as you pass the monitor view and see the green surface of Phaeton growing visibly on its screen. The shrieking alarm sound howls through the corridors like the shipâ€™s last cry. You don't have much time. 


Finally, you reach the escape pod which flickers with red and blue emergency lights.
