M. Harper: Farewell letter
------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Karl,


I thought a lot about us since I've quit the Search and went back to AIV.
This will be my last letter to you.


Have you ever witnessed a philosophical discussion about the meaning of life?
Philosophers and theologists are hilarious.
They always remind me of small children staying awake at Christmas eve to catch a glimpse at Santa Claus.
Gray haired, wise men and women with multiple degrees and stellar IQ's try so hard to find an answer
but forget that the question they argue about is meaningless itself.
It's as they would write dissertations about aerodynamics of tooth fairies.


The universe doesn't owe us a meaning, Karl.
It really does not care.
Our purpose as individuals is not much different from the purpose of a snowflake falling randomly from the sky.


We can't find a meaning in life, so we invent it.
We invent gods, ideologies, principles.
We die for our countries, root for our sport teams and follow our idols.
We pretend to love each other.
We create our artificial meanings of life to forget that in the great scale of things we do not matter.
Neither you. Nor me. Nor us.


I don't want to live an illusion.
The objective truth lingers out there, Karl, and just waits to be discovered.
I don't want emotions to distract me from pursuing it.


Please forgive me.


Mary.
