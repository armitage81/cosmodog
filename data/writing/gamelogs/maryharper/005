M. Harper: Farewell letter
------------------------------------------------------------------
As you touch the monolith, you remember Mary's farewell letter. It hurts, but you face it.

<font:speech> "Dear Karl,


I thought a lot about us since I had left the site and went back to AIV.


This will be my last letter to you.


Have you ever witnessed a philosophical discussion about the meaning of life?
Philosophers and theologists are hilarious.
They always remind me of small children staying awake at Christmas eve to catch a glimpse at Santa Claus.


Gray haired, wise men and women with multiple degrees and stellar IQs, 
trying so hard to find an answer to a question that is meaningless.
It's as if they would write dissertations about aerodynamics of tooth fairies.


The Universe does not owe us a meaning.
It really does not care.
Our purpose as individuals is not much different from the purpose of a snowflake falling randomly from the sky.


We cannot find a meaning in life, so we invent it.


We invent gods, ideologies, principles.


We die for our countries, root for our sport teams and follow our idols.


We pretend to love each other.


We create our artificial meanings of life to forget that in the great scale of things we do not matter.


Neither you. Nor me. Nor us.


I do not want to live an illusion.
The objective truth lingers out there, Karl. It just waits to be discovered.


I do not want emotions to distract me from pursuing it.


Please forgive me.


Mary." <font:narration>
