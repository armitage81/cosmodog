M. Harper: Note on a toy dog in a space suit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Karl,


thanks for the great evening.
It felt good to get some distraction from work.
Your 'Warp Jump' highscore definitely proves that you are the right guy for the job
even if you are beyond hope at sharpshooting. ;)


By the way, I've researched the title of those old cartoon we were talking about.
You were wrong.
It's not Dog in Space, It's Cosmodog.
And guess what?
They still sell them as toys!
Here is one for you.
Maybe, he can help you out as co-pilot during our first expedition.


See you

Mary
