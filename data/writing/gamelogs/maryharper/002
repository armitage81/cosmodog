M. Harper: Night at the excavation site
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Again, you hear Mary's voice. As it reaches you, a warm wave flows through your mind. 
How long it has been! And you remember every single word.


...



<font:speech> "Forget about physics, Karl.
It is all about information. 
Information is the essence of the universe. 
In fact, it forms the line between reality and imagination.


See that star there?


Now move your eyes to that one.


Your glance just crossed the distance of many light years, making its imaginary speed faster than the speed of light. 


How is it possible?


Did you break the laws of physics? 


No, for physics only works when information is transported.


Your interstellar journey happened only in your fantasy.
You would not be able to send a message from one of the stars to the other one in the same time.


Information is the key.


Its exchange is the restriction that allows reality to exist in the boundless world of dreams.


Our current understanding of physics has outlived itself as the language of reality. 
If we want to understand the Universe as a whole, we need a new, more powerful language.
Instead of measuring masses and energies, we should focus our observations exclusively on the exchange of information, 
for every process in our world is merely a special case of this exchange. 


It is time for a new science." <font:narration>


...



Alisa is impressed. 


<font:speech> "Wow, she sounds like she knew what she was taking about. 
If you had children, they would be smart AND beautiful... and maybe had some of your traits, too. 
I don't know, placidity or stubborness, maybe." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Shut up or I turn you off," <font:narration> you growl.


Alisa chuckles. 


<font:speech> "Ok, cancel placidity." <font:narration>
