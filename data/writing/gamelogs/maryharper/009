M. Harper: The purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, two years of work without any progress are needed for an idea
to submerge from nothing when you are bringing out the garbage.


We tend to underestimate the mysterious complexity of the universe and reduce it to its huge scale.
The real mystery, though, hides behind the veil that covers all visible things as huge as they might be.
There are laws and powers holding together the fabric of space and time that can easily blast our limited imagination.


But there is something even more mysterious and marvellous than all those endless layers of dimensions and rules
that make the corset of our world.
A deep and frightening secret that is the answer to the question that bothered me for so long.


I study laws of the universe. 
But at the same time, I am a small part of the same universe.


I am Mary Harper. 


I AM.


Self-awareness is the tool that mutates and structures the informational field.
Intelligence is the instrument for feeding knowledge in this field.
Without knowing the purpose of this field yet, one thing is clear to me now.


Our universe tries to explore herself.
