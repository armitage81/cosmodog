M. Harper: Search for the meaning
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rector called today and asked me to rethink the paper before AIV would publish it.
It would be bad for my reputation as scientist, he said.
I can't blame him.


Five years ago, my current theories would strike myself as blatantly suggestive.
I wouldn't even consider them scientific.
Leave the search for purpose to the creationists, I would say.
Don't waste your time with wishful thinking.


...



But I can't ignore the facts.
All simulations show that the information field contradicts Petrovs law of entropy.
Its transformations move the field towards a target of an incredible complexity.
Unlike the evolution of life, the informational evolution seems to strive for an ideal final state.
This implies purpose.


...



The Scientific Congress is about to turn away from my work.
But that's not important.
I am close.
I feel it.
I will work until I reveal the purpose.
The catharsis of the universe.

The meaning of everything.
