M. Harper: Search for the meaning
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Another one of Mary's memories raises in your head.


...



<font:speech> "Rector called today and asked me to rethink the paper before AIV would publish it.
It would be bad for my reputation as scientist, he said.


I cannot blame him.


Five years ago, I would have considered my current hypothesis religious propaganda.


Leave the search for purpose to the creationists, I would have said. Do not waste your time with wishful thinking.


But I cannot ignore the facts.


All simulations show that the information field contradicts Petrov's law of entropy.


Its transformations move the field towards a state of an incredible complexity.


Unlike the evolution of life, the informational evolution seems to strive for an ideal final state.


This implies purpose.


The Scientific Congress is about to turn away from my work.


But that is not important.


I am close. I feel it.


I will work until I reveal the purpose of the field.


The catharsis of the Universe.


The meaning of everything." <font:narration>
