M. Harper: Proof of concept
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cannot sleep.
They don't provide me machine time on the university computer anymore
but Jenny did me a favor and ran the simulation on the prognosis equation last night.
I've spent the whole day on the analysis.


The results confirm everything.


...



The field is conscious.


It is the biggest mind in the Universe.
It is growing.
And it is especially dense around Phaeton.
Those incidents are related to the field.
The monoliths have something to do with it.


...



I need to get access to one of the monoliths.
Contact the field.
Tap its knowledge.
I have to find a way on Phaetons surface.
