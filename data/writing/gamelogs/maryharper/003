M. Harper: Night at the excavation site
-----------------------------------------------------------------
For a pilot, you're quite a romantic, Karl.
How did we end up the discussion lying on the grass under the night sky?


Anyways, forget physics.
It's all about information. 
Information is the essence of the universe. 
In fact, it forms the line between reality and transcendence.


...



See that star there?
Now move your eyes to this one. 
Your glance has just crossed a distance of many light years, making its imaginary speed faster than the speed of light. 
How could it happen?
Did you break the laws of physics. 
Nope, for physics only works when information is transported. 
Your interstellar journey happened only in your fantasy.
You would not be able to send a message from one of the stars to the other one in the same time. 
Information is the key.
Its exchange is the restriction that allows reality to exist in the boundless world of dreams.


...



I know, it's hard to hear for an engineer, but physics has outlived itself as the language of reality. 
If we want to understand the universe as a whole, we need a new, more powerful language.
Instead of measuring masses and energies, we should focus our observations exclusively on the exchange of information, 
for every process in our world is merely a special case of this exchange. It's time for a new science, Karl.


Let's go back to the camp. Tomorrow will be a busy day.
