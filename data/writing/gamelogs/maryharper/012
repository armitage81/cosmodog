M. Harper: Transcendence

Mary Harper - 012: On phaeton's surface


Alone. 
Landing permission was given on request of the rector as a last favor.
Pity in his eyes.
Fear in the eyes of the pilots.
Debarked me and left immediately.
The younger one tried to talk me out of the idea.
Tired eyes.
Reminded me on the other pilot from long ago.
The one with the toy.
What was his name?
What was the toy?
I believe I tried to forget.
Why did it seem hard?
I'm walking along the abandoned road.
Complete silence.
The chip is working.
Drones are following but leaving me in peace.
I don't know the way.
Following the voices.
Not clear yet, but calming, satisfying.
The truth is in their words.
Objective truth.
Reality.
They are growing louder.
Communicating.
Explaining.
Directing.


Grinning dog.
Inscription on a spaceship - his name. What was his name? Not important. Nothing is important anymore.
Subjective perceptions - so small, so trivial. Emotions. Feelings. Thoughts of an individual.
A misguided person. Woman, torn apart by love and vision.
She is special. Not like the others. She found out on her own. Came to the conclusion based on her theories.
Sacrificed everything. Strong mind. Strong soul. Individuality. She is a volunteer.


'Warp Jump' high score. Shy smile on his face. She is happy at that evening.
A transparent helmet over the dog's ears. A slender person throwing her shadow on the soil of the forbidden valley.
Fatigue. Many have walked her path, on this planet and thousands of others. Many followed the attraction of the field.
But no one did it consciously. No one did it that determined. Pointed to the target.
Thunderstorm. Wet, shining pages scribbled with trivialities. Wrong ideas that led her here.


She climbs the hillside.
Trembling hands. Eyes pointed to the horizon.
The stars over her. Taste of fresh grass. His arm under her head. Moment of happiness.
He had a simple name. But not important. Not important.
She falls. Stands up. Falls again.
She is with us. She is here. She knows what we know and we know what she knows.
Her body is slowly rolling down the hill.
She is piercing through the field from one edge of the universe to the other and then back again.
But she is not dissipating.


The body comes to a hold. Looks at the stars. Looks through them.
Lips whispering words that have no meaning.
Fingers clasping the grass.
She has joined. But she is still She. Her personality flows through the field.
Learning, forming. But not dissipating. She is special. She is strong. She still IS.
