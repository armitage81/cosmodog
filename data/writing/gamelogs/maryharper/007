M. Harper: Distractions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Another memory that belongs not to you but to Mary.

 
You hear her thoughts clearly as if she would stay near to you.


You ask yourself if you knew Mary. If you REALLY knew her...

<font:speech> "A whole week spent on the Prognosis equation without any progress being made.


Greasy hair, empty fridge, hundreds of unread messages.


All for nothing.


Blamed it on fatigue, age and lack of talent first, but the truth is, i am still being distracted.


Thinking about him. Missing him.


I try to forget.
To focus on work.


Threw away all souvenirs of our past.
Deleted the pictures.
Cut common contacts.


But this stupid Cosmodog is still grinning in my face everytime I close my eyes.


I won't let him win.


I won't allow biochemistry taking control over my mental resources.
This equation has to have a solution." <font:narration>
