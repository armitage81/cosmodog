M. Harper: About free will

Mary Harper - 004: Letter about the free will


There is another note raising in your memory. As you read it, the whispering voices around you seem to tune in and repeat the words in millions of tongues.


"Dear Karl,


I always believed in free will. Today, this belief was shattered.


It happened on a shuttle station, when I saw a young couple in the waiting hall.
The angry man was screaming at his female companion,
insulted her in front of the crowd without even hiding his disdain for her.
The woman just stood there, head down, trying to hold back tears.
The shuttle came and the man entered it.
She hesitated for a second, looked up, and our eyes met.
Her expression, that of shame and embarrassment.
Finally, she bowed her head and followed the man into the shuttle.


Which force pulled her inside?
What power tied her to an asocial ruffian when the most rational thing would be to walk away?
I think I know.


Free will is worth nothing if such a trivial thing as love can stamp it into the ground.
What meaning does it have if it can be destroyed without even applying torture, sickness or social disadvantage to its host?
Free will is an illusion of a mind trying to convince itself
of having control while it can't even handle its own impulses.


Missing you so much


Mary"


"That was deep," Alisa remarks and goes on mute. Maybe, she needs some time to think about Mary's words.


You don't mind the silence.
