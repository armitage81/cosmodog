M. Harper: About free will
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a memory of another note. 
As you read it, the whispering voices around you seem to tune in and repeat
the words in millions of tongues.

<font:speech> "Dear Karl,


I always believed in free will. Today, this belief was shattered.


It happened on a shuttle station, when I saw a young couple in the waiting hall.
The angry woman was screaming at her male companion,
insulted him in front of the crowd without even hiding her disdain.
The man just stood there, head down, without reacting.
The shuttle came and the woman entered it.
The man hesitated for a second then looked up, and our eyes met.
His look expressed shame and embarrassment.
Finally, he sank his head and followed the woman into the shuttle.


Which force pulled him inside?
What power tied him to an asocial ruffian when the most rational thing would be to walk away?


I think I know.


Free will is worth nothing if such a trivial thing as love can stifle it.


It is our impulses that drive us, not our will.


Missing you so much.


Mary." <font:narration>


...



<font:speech> "That was deep," <font:narration> Alisa remarks and goes on mute.
Maybe, she needs some time to think about Mary's words.


You don't mind the silence.
