M. Harper: A xenoarchaeology class speech
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you dive into the memory, you hear Mary's voice - loud and clear, as if it was recorded. 
You remember the lecture, of course.


...



<font:speech> "An archaeologist's job is to reveal the past.
In this class we will start from the very beginning.


At the beginning, there was nothing.


It was not the Nothing in the meaning of an endless dark empty space. 
There was not even this. 


No space. 


No time.


No mind to witness the surreality of a non-existent world. 


Pure Nothing in its quintessence.


And then something happened.


Although, 'then' has no meaning in a timeless world. 


It just HAPPENED.


The Universe just... started to exist..." <font:narration>


...



<font:speech> "Well," <font:narration> Alisa says as you come back to your senses. 
<font:speech> "Sounds interesting. Still, I wouldn't bet my money on it all having happened exactly that way." <font:narration>


You don't deign her with a response. The idea of questioning Mary simply never came to your mind.
