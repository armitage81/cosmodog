M. Harper: A xenoarchaeology class speech
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An archaeologist's job is to reveal the past.
In this class we will start from the very beginning.


At the beginning, there was nothing.
It was not the Nothing in the meaning of an endless dark empty space. 
There was not even this. No space. 
No time.
No mind to witness the surreality of a non-existent world. 
Pure Nothing in its quintessence.


...



And then something happened.
Although, 'then' has no meaning in a timeless world. 
It just HAPPENED.
The universe just... started to exist.
Or, maybe, something beyond our dimensions led it to existence.


I can already see a smile on your face, Mr. Novak, but before you bring a god to the table,
try to realize the low and underwhelming cheapness of all human legends and myths
in the light of the mind-blowing process that created our world.
