M. Harper: A xenoarchaeology class speech
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Mary's journal that led you to Phaeton.
You watched every single recording. Even the painful ones. Even the one she sent you from here.
Now, standing in the monolith's shadow, you recollect one of Mary's first recorded lessons.


...



<font:speech> "The job of an archaeologist is to reveal the past.
In this class we will start from the very beginning.


At the beginning, there was nothing.


Not the "Nothing" in the meaning of an endless dark empty space.
There was not even this. 


No space. 


No time.


No mind to witness the surreality of a non-existent world. 


Pure Nothing in its quintessence.


Until something happened.


Well, the word "until" has no meaning in a timeless world.


It just HAPPENED.


The Universe just... started to exist..." <font:narration>


...


You wake up, the cry still clinging to your ears. Another failure.


As always, Alisa is eager to comment your memory.


<font:speech> "Well," <font:narration>  she says.
<font:speech> "That sounded interesting. Still, I wouldn't bet my money on it all having happened exactly that way." <font:narration>


You don't deign her with a response. The idea of questioning Mary simply never came to your mind.
