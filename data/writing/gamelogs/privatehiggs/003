Private Higgs' journal - entry 3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Managed to read two out of five letters from Paola to clear the conscience.
We're approaching the outskirts of Gasolinera.
It's windy.
No resistance till now, but the fields and houses seem abandoned.
We're not wasting time with investigations. Our target is the town.


Johnson acts strangely.
Whispers something to himself.
Looks around as if haunted.
I've asked him what's wrong but he just shook his head and turned away.
I think he is afraid.


During the dinner, Ramirez and Lesin chatted about a monolith that's supposed to be the reason for the riots.
Not Dream Weavers.
Captain cut the talking short.


Night is approaching but we don't see the town lights ahead.
