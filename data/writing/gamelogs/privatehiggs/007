Private Higgs' journal - entry 7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had a nightmare.


Paola was there, lying at the foot of the monolith, screaming about some prophecy.
Captain shot her in the head, again and again, but she kept talking.
Called me out, named me a traitor.


I woke up to some whispering.
Thought it was Johnson again but he isn't in the tent.


Whispering turns out to be wind.
The flap is open. Johnson's boots are standing here, though.  
Strong urge to go and find him. 
He must have gone to the square center to see the monolith. 


The monolith is the answer. It knows what happened here. It knows so much...


A shot!
