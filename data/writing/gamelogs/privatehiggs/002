Private Higgs' journal - entry 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
During rest, captain told us about Dream Weavers.
Descendants of the first colonists sent here hundred or so years ago.
The Lucky Quarter they were called.
Criminals.
Won their chance in the lottery to start a new life in an off-world colony.


The other three quarters turned out to be luckier.
Wild predators, infertile soil, swamps and deserts, Phaeton had no mercy for the colonists.
Half of the population died in the first decade on the planet.
The other half decimated themselves by fights, incest and drug-addiction until they decided to stop the madness
and established a community based on a weird religion.


They called themselves Dream Weavers.


Well, seems they exist and thrive up to these days
and if Gasolinera's citizen are in hand of those lunatics, I don't envy the poor bastards.
