Private Higgs' journal - entry 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the rest, captain told us about the Dream Weavers.
These guys are nuts!
Descendants of the first colonists sent here hundred or so years ago.
The Lucky Quarter they were called.
Criminals.
Won their chance in the lottery to start a new life in an off-world colony.


The other three quarters turned out to be luckier.
Phaeton knew no mercy.
Wild predators, infertile soil, swamps and deserts, you name it.
Half of the colonists died in the first decade on the planet.
The other half ripped themselves in fights, incest and drug-addiction until they decided to stop the madness
and established a more or less stable community based on a weird religion
that involved consumption of a self-made drug called the Soul Essence.
Chose a fitting name, too - the Dream Weavers.


Well, seems they exist and thrive up to these days
and if Gasolinera's citizen are in hand of those lunatics, I don't envy the poor bastards.
