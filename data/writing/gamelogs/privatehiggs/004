Private Higgs' journal - entry 4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was an attack.
God, I can hardly hold the recorder.
Hands are shaking.
My first firefight.
They've sneaked upon us just before the dawn.
Silhouettes in the night.
Heard the guard screaming and then the hell broke loose.
They came from all sides.
Shot five of our men before we even could retaliate.
Captain got wounded.
Screamed and cursed like an animal.
Barked at me to fight back.


I grabbed the gun and shot into the darkness.
Saw some shadows falling in the distance.
It felt good.
I controlled the situation.
No fear.
Not until it all ended.
Shot at least six of them and then two more when they were already running.
Heard a loud roaring and recognized my own voice. What a thrill!


They left one of them on the field, wounded.
A woman.
Ugly, greasy hair, mad eyes.
Resembled Paola.
She moaned and screamed some gibberish about a prophecy and a power that would consume us.
Captain shot her.
Wouldn't make it anyway.
We count eight men lost and three wounded.
Moving out toward the town center.
