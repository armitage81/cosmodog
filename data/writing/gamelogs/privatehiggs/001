Private Higgs' journal - entry 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
My father was never happy with his only son.


Boring job. Ugly wife. No achievements. According to dad, I lack any hint of ambition.


He wasn't even impressed when they'd drawn me in for service on Phaeton.

It's always clear what is expected from one.
Hard work and some danger, but at least they tell you in which direction to march.


We're on our way to Gasolinera.
A town to the East of Lydport.
Contact to the town cut three days ago.
Captain suspects Dream Weavers.
Our company was sent out for inspection.
This could become my first firefight.
We'll see.
I'm not the one taking decisions here.
