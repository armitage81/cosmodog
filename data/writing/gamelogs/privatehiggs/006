Private Higgs' journal - entry 6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
We found them all at the main square.
Gathered around the big red structure in the center of the place.


Men, women, children.
Hundreds of them.
Some dead, but most just demented.
Not sure whether I can ever forget the sight.
There was no fight here.
Many of the dead had handguns lying close to them. 


Suicides.


Then we saw a group roaming among the corpses.
Dream Weavers, no doubt.
Dreads, dirty clothes, primitive guns.
Tried to flee when surrounded but gave up soon after we shot three of them.
Beat them unconscious.


Perhaps the interrogation will shed some light on what happened here.
