Private Higgs' journal - entry 10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was alone.


The whispers of the call grew louder.
I heard the voices calling me, promising comfort and solace.


The monolith started to consume my mind and its embrace felt wonderful.


Except I didn't want to give in.
The fight with the captain triggered something in me.
I did not want to be manipulated anymore.
I followed orders my whole life.
It was time to take control.


I thought of Johnson.
He appeared weird, but he was the strongest of them all.
He took his own decision.


I could do the same.


I loaded the gun, closed the eyes and thought of dad and Paola.
The wind tore at my skin.
I smiled and lifted the gun.
The metal felt comfortably cool on my temple.
The whispering got quieter.


I was myself again.


I was in control.


Even if for the last moment of my life.


Something hit my arm.


Flashing pain.


The gun clicked on the ground.


I snapped my eyes open and saw the boy.


I jumped up to grab the gun but he kicked it away with a surprising dexterity.


<font:speech> "No need for this," <font:narration>  he said and presented his hand. In it was a small glass jar with a murky fluid inside.


<font:speech> "There is another way out." <font:narration>
