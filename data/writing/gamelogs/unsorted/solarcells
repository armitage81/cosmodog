Message of the maintenance mechanic

The evacuation hasn't finished yet but the drones are fully operational. 
They roam around autonomously and attack everyone stupid enough to approach one of the monoliths.
Harsh means but the epidemy is too dangerous to allow some stubborn villager to spread it beyond the valley.

Some of the machines come back damaged. They bear traces of human weapons - shotguns, rifles, sometimes even mines. 
I don't want to know what happened to the attackers. I don't want to know whether they really were attackers at all.


There is not enough power for repairs. I have to power the facility by solar cells. Obviously, this means we need to pause work after sunset.
Night will be a weak spot. Let's hope we won't become the object of a local farmers raid.
