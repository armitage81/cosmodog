Random joke
-------------------------------------------------------
A guy sees a sign outside a bar that says "come in! We have a magic ashtray that will grant one wish if you buy a pint"


He walks in to a swanky piano lounge which, interestingly, had a dwarf playing the piano.


He buys a pint and the bartender tells him to hold the ashtray and make his wish.


He squints and makes his wish. Suddenly a million ducks start swarming out from behind the bar and begin to cause total chaos.


The man yells to the bartender over the noise "I wished for a million BUCKS not DUCKS!!!"


The bartender yelled back "do you think I wished for a 3 foot pianist!?!"
