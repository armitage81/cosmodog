Military Engineer's Notebook
-------------------------------------------------------
It's crazy! When I come back to Lydport, I will compile a formal protest.


Mines, for God's sake! Mines!


I understand that we have to protect the population and stop the spread of the epidemic, but land mines?! Really?!


I graduated from the Military Engineering School to help disarm these horrible things, not to set them up.



They say the monolith must not be approached. That the warning signs will prevent people from entering the mined areas.


Ha! What about children? What about elderly people? What about fishermen who land on the island at night?
Will they spot the warning signs in the darkness? Will they even care? Those monoliths attract people like fire attracts moths.
They will just walk through the mine fields mindlessly, even if their comrades will blow up next to them.


Whoever reads this. STOP! Don't go any further. You will step on a land mine and die. Turn around and forget the monolith.


If you don't have a choice, find a mine detector and use it to track the save path through the field.


If you are with the SUF, you can use the deactivation codes to disable all mines in a quadrant remotely, via special terminals.



And a last note to myself, in case I have to traverse the mine field in the future. The mines are laid out in a pattern.
I used the Menesian ruins to indicate their locations. There are three rules for finding a safe path:


1) Big pillars are Rooks, little pillars are Bishops;


2) There are no mines crossing the pieces' legal moves;


3) Tiled places are safe.
