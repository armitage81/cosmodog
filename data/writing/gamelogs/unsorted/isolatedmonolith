AIV lead inspectors notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The peculiarity of this monolith is its isolation. The area is surrounded by rocks. 
The narrow passage along the river bed has formed itself centuries after the construction of the monolith. 
The absence of usual ruins, burial places and temples allows the  detailed analysis of the structure.


These things are ancient. 


The first check dates the monolith to the age before the first menesian settlement. 
In fact, no intelligent life forms inhabited the valley at the time of its creation.


The materials and the construction processes leave many questions open, but two things are clear. 
First of all, the engineers of these monoliths are of the same species
as the builders of the large sealed structure in the center of the valley.
Secondly, these builders are not of native origin.
