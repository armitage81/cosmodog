AIV lead inspectors notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My research shows that the monoliths have been built at the peak of the Menesian civilization.


But the interesting thing is: The monoliths are too advanced for the Menesians to have built them.


The same can be said about the big sealed structure in the middle of the valley.
Its age coincides with the age of the monoliths. Two things are certain:


First, whoever constructed the structure is also responsible for the monoliths.


And second: The builders were not of native origin.
