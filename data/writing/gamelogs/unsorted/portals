Log entry of the polygon supervisor
------------------------------------------------------------
I've messed it up. Professor was right, I should've studied agriculture rather than quantum physics. 
The variables that I've used to set up the singularity for the portal drill were clearly wrong. 
God knows how many passages have been created around the valley by my stupidity.


I've realized my mistake after I've stepped into the portal that was supposed to bring me back to the lab. 
Ended up in a cave without exits, buried alive. 


Instruments show two portals out of here. However, I have no clue where the passages are heading to. 
With my luck I'll end up just right above the volcano. 


I'll throw this log card through one of the portals and go through the second one. 
If anyone was harmed by my ignorance, please forgive me.
