Captain's security notice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to maintenance, teleport connections out of the base have been suspended.
Temporarily, all jumps have been redirected to the archive room and the access has been restricted.


To unlock the security mechanism, execute the standard procedure in the control room:


Initialize the teleport by providing the gravity impulse and triggering the ignition.
Turn on the dynamo to generate power.
Repeat the gravity impulse, then initiate space warping and turn on ignition again.
