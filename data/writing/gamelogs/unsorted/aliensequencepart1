Captain's security notice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To unlock the security mechanism, execute the standard procedure in the control room:


Initialize the teleport by providing the GRAVITY IMPULSE and triggering the IGNITION.
Turn on the DYNAMO to generate power.
Repeat the GRAVITY IMPULSE, then initiate SPACE WARPING and turn on IGNITION again.

(A note is scribbled underneath the message)

There is a problem with the sequence. Ask the main engineer for the workaround.
