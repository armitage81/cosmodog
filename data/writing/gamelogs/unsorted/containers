Scrap Yard Worker's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing scrap is a boring job. Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is solving puzzles.
When the postal helicopter drops the regular delivery, there are always puzzle magazines in it.


The problem is:
I solve all the puzzles within days and am bored for weeks afterwards until the next package is dropped.


Boredom feeds creativity. I heard about the Menesian religious trials and decided to reproduce one of them
myself. These temples are great puzzles, after all.


Instead of stone blocks, I use scrap containers. Car wrecks are the walls. A hydraulic press acts as the ritual portal.
I even simulated the sacred chamber by building the puzzle around one of those ancient monoliths.


It works perfectly. The only thing is...


I forgot the solution.


I'm trying to solve my own puzzle since days but it just does not work.


I clearly remember the beginning of the solution:


Middle Block: North, West.

Top Block: South, South.

Middle Block: West, South, South, North


But what then?!
