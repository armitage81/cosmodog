Message to the SUF officer John Maier

Maier, let the damn fence be fixed ASAP. This post might be the most boring spot on the whole planet but it will change fast if a pigrat enters the place through the hole. And I want to know who is responsible for the damage. These cuts look to clean to be an accident. I think, someone uses it at night as a secret passage out of the camp. 


And another thing: I don't remember your patrol route to lead through the monolith island, so stop it. I don't know why it fascinates you so much, but the island is still off-limits. 


Also at night, if you know what I mean.
