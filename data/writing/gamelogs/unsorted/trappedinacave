Hastily scribbled note
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh my god, they found us! 

The drone somehow managed to cross the river and is roaming around the entrance to the cave.
We've set up a barricade but it won't stop the damn thing if it decides to break in.
There are only three of us here, all women.


The men left to transport the Soul Essence to our brothers in the West.


There are shotguns and ammunition in the cave but we are no fighters.
Luise is only fifteen. I pray that the walker won't find us. Otherwise, we have to be ready.
