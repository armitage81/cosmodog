A page from a dirty journal
------------------------------------------------
This place is perfect for a camp. The old touristic road is hardly used since the waterfalls in the North dried out and the pass out of the valley has been filled up after the avalanches. No one but animals leaves traces here. The cave is big enough for the lab and the personal quarters. We have enough weapons to defend the production against uninvited guests and the produced Soul Essence gives us strength to resist the Call. Our brethren in the valley can count on us.
