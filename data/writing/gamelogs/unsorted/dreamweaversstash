A page from a dirty journal
------------------------------------------------
This place is perfect for a field lab.


The old touristic road is hardly used since the waterfalls in the North
dried out.


The cave is well-hidden and big enough to hold the equipment and the cooks.
With all the weapons stashed here, we will be able to defend the production of the Soul Essence
against uninvited guests.


The work can begin.
