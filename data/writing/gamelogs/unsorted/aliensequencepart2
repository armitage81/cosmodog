Main engineer's note
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attention! 


A problem has been discovered in the conductors of the teleport gate.
In case the gate cannot be activated by the usual sequence,
consider executing the initialization step twice in order to double the impulse.
Do not forget that every impulse has to be followed by the ignition procedure.

You will also need to provide twice as much power directly after the initialization process.


The maintenance team is working on the solution.
