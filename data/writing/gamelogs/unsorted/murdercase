A message to the local law enforcement officer Alessandro Faraday
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lt. Faraday


It happened again. Another person has been reported missing in your area today. And yet again we received a phone call with a voice quoting some weird poem. This is the tenth case in the last two months. 


My patience is finite. There is a serial killer in your sector, lieutenant, a damn psycho. Catch him. If your investigation won't bear any fruits soon I will send in my men.


I want to see some results.
