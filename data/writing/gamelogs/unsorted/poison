Biochemist's report
-------------------------------------------------------
Fernando, what the hell!? I have spent three days to come here because you needed my expertise. 
The soil that emits deadly poison from the plant roots within it, that's what you've promised me.


Really?


Well, if you guys had the smarts to dig a meter deep, you would've noticed the pipes.
Pipes, for Christ's sake!


The plants are not poisonous. Nor is the soil.
The natives have built up a pipe system around the ruins to create traps.
Seems to work well enough after all these years, considering the losses in your team.


Tell your guys to avoid the leaks while working at the site. Its not too difficult.
During my visit, I managed to circumvent a poison pool by squeezing myself through a narrow passage in a wall.
Those walls are so old they remind me of Swiss cheese. There are holes everywhere.


Please order an antidote at the central.
Also construct some decontamination pools until the antidote arrives.
They will protect your people from the most dire poison injuries.


And don't waste my time anymore, brother. You need an archaeologist here, not a goddamn biochemist.
