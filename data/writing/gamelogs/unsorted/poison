Biochemist's report
-------------------------------------------------------
Fernando, what the hell!? I was so naive to think you've called me because of my expertise. 
The soil that emits deadly poison from the plant roots within it, that's what you've promised me.


Well, if you guys had the smarts to dig a meter deep, you would've notice the pipes.
Pipes, for Christ's sake!


The plants are poisonous, indeed. Deadly, too. Nothing unusual. But the soil is not.
The natives have built up a pipe system around the ruins to create traps.
Seems to work well enough after all these years, considering the losses in your team.


Build up decontamination pools around until I come up with the antidote.
And please don't waste my time anymore. You need an archeologist here, not a goddamn biochemist.
