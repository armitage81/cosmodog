From the instruction manual of a drone
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operation modes of military drones have to be understood in order to maintain damaged units.


A deployed drone will autonomously roam the given area of interest and attack every moving target.
The unit will NEVER leave the assigned region. The scan radius of a drone will be reduced at night.


Units can be constrained by the terrain in the area of interest. Deployment of wheeled units requires proper ground conditions while tracked and walking units can cross almost all terrain types.
Only copter drones should be deployed in naval areas of interest.


The manufacturer will not take responsibility for casualties caused by wrong usage of military drones.
