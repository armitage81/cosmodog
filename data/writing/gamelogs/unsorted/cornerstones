Look, I'm not greedy, ok? I left some for you. This thing is hot as hell. I feel as if I could fly. 
The stars are shifting their positions, babe. It won't be for long but it is totally worth it.


I want to share. I know, you will come here one day and find this message. I've hidden one jar of it in our usual place. Remember?


Just follow the corner stones as we did back then. I haven't forgotten it, baby. In all these years, I haven't forgotten!


Start at the road and go south until a corner stone blocks your path. Then go east till you stumble upon another cornerstone. It will lead south again. And so on...


The drug waits at the end. Don't miss it, babe. 


You... You will not come, right? Why would you? A stupid idea. We broke up five years ago. I'm still high. Cannot think clearly... Just... in case you will somehow find this message. Follow the corner stones, baby. 


Find the stuff. It'll make you happy, like it makes me happy. Because you haven't.
