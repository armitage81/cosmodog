Look, I'm not greedy, ok? I left some for you. This thing is hot as hell. I feel as if I could fly. 
The stars are shifting their positions, babe. It won't be for long but it is totally worth it.


I want to share. I know, you will come here one day and find this message. I've hidden one jar of it in our usual place. Remember?
Just follow the corner stones as we did back then. I haven't forgottent it, baby. I haven't forgotten you in all these years.


You... You will not come, right? Why would you? What a stupid idea. I'm still high. Cannot think clearly... Just... in case you will somehow find this message. Follow the corner stones, baby. 
Find the stuff. It'll make you happy, even if only for a short time, like it makes me happy, because you haven't.
