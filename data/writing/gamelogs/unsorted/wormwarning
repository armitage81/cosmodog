Ice fisherman's note
-------------------------------------------------------
They have laughed at me all these years. A typical fisher, they said. Always exaggerating the size of the trophy and making up stories.
But I SAW the worm. I saw it with my own eyes and a thing of this size is hard to mix up with something else, even for a child.


...



But the geologists did not want to believe. 
They said, the area would be tectonically instable and the rumble was caused by the earthquakes. 
They built up their labs and started to drill their holes. Dambasses!
 
 
I've tried to warn them, but who would listen to a simple fisherman with a vivid imagination.


...



Serves them right. Their drilling enraged the beast. It went on the rampage and destroyed the labs. 
They believed me now if anyone would've survived. Anyway, whoever finds this message: beware of the worm.


Do not walk on snow!
