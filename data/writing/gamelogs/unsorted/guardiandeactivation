The Guardian Engineer's Note
-------------------------------------------------------
The chamber where the monoliths are constructed is a very important room.


Its symbolic meaning is so critical that we have to restrict access to it. The Builders must be able to focus without any interruptions while contemplating on the meaning of the monoliths.


Normal key cards are insufficient to achieve the confidentiality of the construction process. Hence, we created the Guardian unit which will stop anyone but a Builder.


A manual override is the only way to deactivate the Guardian. The unit will be destroyed in the process.


Sixteen software chips are required to activate the manual override. They are hidden throughout the valley. Only I know their location. Place all sixteen chips into the terminal in this room to initiate the manual override.


Use the manual override only in an extreme emergency.
