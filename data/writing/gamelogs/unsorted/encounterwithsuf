They found our supply stash. Randomly! An SUF jeep halted at the end of its patrol route and a soldier got out to relieve himself. He went into the trees and saw the entrance to the cave. We watched the scene together with Manuel from a nearby guard spot. We hoped the soldier would ignore the cave but he was curious enough to approach the entrance and looked inside. Manuel whispered we should notify the others but leaving the soldiers alone was not an option. We Dream Weavers despise unnecessary violence but I could not let our position be discovered. Manuel took the driver while I aimed at the one near the cave. Both fell simultaneously as our bullets hit them. We buried the bodies and drove the jeep in the nearby pond. Before we sank it, I removed the armored plates from the vehicle and deposited them in the cave together with other supplies. They can prove useful when it comes to protecting of the northern cave lab.
