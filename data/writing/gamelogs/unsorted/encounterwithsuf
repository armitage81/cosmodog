They found our supply stash.


An SUF jeep halted near the cave and a soldier got out to relieve himself.
He went into the trees and saw the entrance to the stash.
We watched the scene together with Manuel from a nearby guard spot.


We hoped the soldier would ignore the cave but he was too curious for his own good.


We Dream Weavers despise unnecessary violence but I could not let our position be discovered.
Manuel took out the driver while I aimed at the one near the cave.
Both fell simultaneously as our bullets hit them.


We buried the bodies and drove the jeep in the nearby pond.
Before we sank it, I removed the armored plates from the vehicle and deposited
them in the cave together with other supplies.
They can prove useful when it comes to protecting the nearby field lab.
