A girl's voice message
------------------------------------------------------------
Sam, you won! I can't find you. I give up.


You won't believe what just happened.


I've counted till hundred and then again,
and when I opened my eyes I saw one of those big things coming at me! 
It was the one that we'd seen with daddy last Saturday. He'd called it a drone, meaning there are no drivers inside.
It came straight at me through the corn field. 


I ran, but it changed direction and turned its cannons towards me. 


It was scary! I did not know what to do. I just ran, but the drone came closer and closer.
Then I stumbled and fell. My knee still hurts.
The thing stopped at the same moment. It could not see me in the grass! It just stood there, rattling. 
I crawled between the stems until it came out of sight.


This was the best game of hide-and-seek EVER!
