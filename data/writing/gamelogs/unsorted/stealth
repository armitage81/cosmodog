A girl's voice message
------------------------------------------------------------
Sam, where are you? You won't believe what happened! 


I've counted till hundred and then again,
and when I opened my eyes I saw one of those big things coming at me! 
It was the one that we saw with my dad last Saturday. He called it a drone, said there were no drivers inside. 
It came straight at me through the corn field. 


I ran, but it changed direction and turned its cannons towards me. 


It was scary! I did not know what to do. I just ran, but the drone came closer and closer. Then I stumbled and fell. My knee still hurts. 
The thing stopped at the same moment. It could not see me in the grass! It just stood there, rattling. 
I crawled between the stems until it came out of sight. This was the best game of hide-and-seek EVER!
