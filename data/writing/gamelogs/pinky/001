Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1


They have gone. All of them, one by one. Mostly at night. Carlos, Rita, Manuel. Dozens of others, whose names I haven't the chance to learn. All of them, except the ones who fell victims to pigrats. They followed the wind. The whispers within.


I hear them, too. Always had since the expedition has started. Voices in my head. Whispering in the wind. Calling. The others gave in. Could not resist. But I can. I will not approach that distant thing. I know what it does to people.


I will escape. The swamp is a dangerous place but there is enough food and water stored in the nearby camps and the tents will give me protection from the pigrats. It is not much but it will suffice. I will find a way out of here. Just shouldn't leave the roads.
