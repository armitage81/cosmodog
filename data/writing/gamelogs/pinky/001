Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1


They have gone.
All of them, one by one.
Mostly at night.
The whole expedition team: Carlos, Rita, Manuel...
Dozens of others, whose names I never learned.
They followed the wind. The whispers within.


I hear them, too.
Always have since the expedition started.
Voices in my head.
Whispering in the wind.
Calling.


The others gave in.
Could not resist.
But I can.
I will not approach that monolith.
I know what it does to people.


I will escape.
The swamp is a dangerous place but there is enough food and water stored in the nearby camps
and the tents will give me protection from the pigrats.
It is not much but it will suffice.
I will find a way out of here.
Just shouldn't leave the roads.
