Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 5


I reached the nearest camp and found it abandoned, as expected.


The wind settled today and the fog became thicker.
My strained imagination paints pink claws and fangs of pigrats on the edge of the clearing.
I hear their screeching calls in the reeds but the animals do not approach the camp.
The critters scare me to death. I saw what they did to Maria.


I will leave this place tomorrow.


I hope I'm moving in the right direction.
