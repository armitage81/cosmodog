Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 8


Luckily, I'd reached the camp before the rain started,
but to my horror I realized that it was not the Adrian camp.
It was the Ferrera excavation.
Turns out, I'd lost the way and reached the site by pure chance.


I speak to myself just to hear a human voice.
Will stay in the tent until the rain stops.


Pinky is howling outside. He doesn't seem to like the weather. I almost feel pity for him.


Almost.
