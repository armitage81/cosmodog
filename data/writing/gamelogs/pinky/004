Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg

Day 7


The road is a thin line between the reed stems. The air smells cool and moist and the low sky is covered by angry clouds. I have to make it to the Adrian camp before it starts raining.


One of them is following me. I can hear it in the fog behind my back. Screeching and grunting, a terrifying sound crossing the whispering of the wind. Usually, pigrats donâ€™t dare to enter or cross roads, but this one is persistent. Perhaps, it is hungry. It did not attack me yet. Maybe, it waits until it gets dark. The idea fills my heart with terror.


When I was little, my elder brother brought home a stray dog. He had pity for the poor creature. It was a big one, black with a white spot on the face. The dog barked and roared and spinned around like he owned the place. Every time he saw someone holding a long item, like a stick or a bat, his black eyes flared up and he grinned and growled like a demon, ready to jump at the throat of the supposed attacker.


The dog scared me to death. I was terrified. When I saw him, I immediately started to cry. That is, until my brother gave the dog a name. It was Snowflake, for the obvious reason. When I heard the name I laughed. The fear has gone. Since then I could not take the barking and the growling seriously. Someone called Snowflake could not be bad. Snowflake was a good boy. We became friends.


I will give a name to the creature in the fog. I will call it Pinky.


For the obvious reason.
