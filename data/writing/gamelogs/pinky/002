Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 3


Walking along the muddy road through the endless sea of reed.


The stems are taller than me.
Something lurks between them.


Pigrats?


The wind drains my focus and makes the navigation difficult.


Earlier in the morning, I almost stepped into a trap.
Hunters set them up all over the swamp to scare off pigrats.
The trap snapped with a dry click as I touched it with a twig.
The vague silhouette in the reed jerked away from the road as it perceived the sound.


I am afraid.
