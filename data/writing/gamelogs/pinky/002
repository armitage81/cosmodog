Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg

Day 3


Walking on the muddy road through the endless sea of reed. Something lurks between the stems. The wind drains my focus and makes the navigation difficult. In the morning I almost stepped into a trap. Hunters set them up all over the swamp to scare off pigrats. It snapped with a dry click as I touched it with a twig. The vague silhouette in the reed jerked away from the road as it perceived the sound. A pigrat? I am afraid.
