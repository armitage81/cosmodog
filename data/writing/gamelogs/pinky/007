Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 10


My compass is obstructed by the ore fields and the map is useless in this featureless landscape.
The road is hardly visible, it is merely a path covered by murky puddles and leaves.


I'm tired.


Pinky is still following me.
I can see his head rising over the reeds when he makes a clumsy jump in an attempt to catch a field mouse.
He doesn't seem to consider me as a threat any more even though he is still too shy to approach me.
From time to time his steps fade away in the distance and then i find a dead lizard or a swamp lemming on the road
in front of me.


Thanks Pinky. I appreciate the help.
