Notes of the archaeologist Anna Weinberg

Day 9


I managed to catch a glimpse on Pinky this morning.
Turns out, he is just a baby, a calf, not bigger than a cow.
Still ugly and dangerous but at the same time helpless and pitiful.
As I came out of the tent, he was lying near the heater at the edge of the clearing,
warming his pink skin after the chilly night.
He must have lost his pack. All alone, just like myself.


When he saw me, Pinky jumped up, scratched the dirt with his claws,
produced a wailing howl and dashed away into the safety of the reed stems.


The rain does not stop.
I will have to spend another night at Ferrera's.
Before going to sleep, I opened five rations and put them in front of the heater
at the edge of the clearing.
