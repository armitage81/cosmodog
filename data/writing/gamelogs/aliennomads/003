Nomad's chronicles - part 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The monolith changed the way how we perceived the world.


Knowing nothing of its builders, we were humiliated by their potential.

Our science, philosophy and arts advanced in never seen proportions.
This cultural evolution verged on transcendence.
And the monolith was its beacon, the source for our enlightenment.
