Nomad's chronicles - part 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greed for knowledge can be a strong motivation.


I gathered those around me who, like me, had experienced the monoliths influence.
Together, we confronted the ethical council.


The debate was fierce but despite good arguments we could not convince our opponents.
The monolith was destroyed and its knowledge declared forbidden. 


We revolted and lost. We were banned. 


We became nomads.
