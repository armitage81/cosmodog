Nomad's chronicles - part 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The monolith must not be destroyed.


I gathered around me the ones who thought the same. Together, we confronted the ethical council.


Looking back, I understand that our arguments, our voices, our thoughts, were not only our own.
The soft whispers we heard gave us strength, the intellectual power of a billion minds, condensed in the field around the monolith.


The debate was fierce but despite all we could not convince our opponents.
The monolith was destroyed and its knowledge declared forbidden. 


We revolted and lost. We were banned. 


We became nomads.
