Nomad's chronicles - part 21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
All Menesians are gone.


My comrades are gone, too.


I am the last nomad. The last living being on this world.


Now, it's my turn.


Sing to me, friends. Tell me what you know. Show me the ultimate Truth.


I am ready.
