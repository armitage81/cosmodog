Nomad's chronicles - part 6b

This planet harbours a primitive culture of natives. They call themselves Menesians.


Hardly a threat, the natives see us as gods and treat us with respect and friendliness.


If we succeed, we will become their gods, indeed.


What fate will we bring upon this people, though?


Will it be salvation? Or doom?


We build, and we think.
