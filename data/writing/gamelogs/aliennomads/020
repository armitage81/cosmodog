Nomad's chronicles - part 20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
They are dying, one by one.


Caught in the monoliths' field, there is no reason for them to cling to this inferior form of existence.


It is only a matter of time till the Menesian civilization will be no more.


Now I know what happened to the species which had held the monolith found by us.
The same will happen to the Menesians.


I have no pity for them and their civilization. Because this is not a downfall.


This is transcendence.
