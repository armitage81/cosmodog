Nomad's chronicles - part 6b
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This world has finished the fifth cycle around its sun when we managed to construct the first replica of the monolith.


Many others followed.


We installed them across the valley, but nothing happened.


We felt no inspiration. And neither did the Menesians.


The monoliths just stood there - silent, soulless witnesses of our failure.
