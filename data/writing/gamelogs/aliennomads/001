Nomad's chronicles - part 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are not native to this world. 
Our home must not be named. 
Our people must not be mentioned. 
We are the outcasts. 
Bearers and pursuers of forbidden knowledge. 
We call ourselves Nomads.


Our homeworld has forgotten us.


Our days are counted.
