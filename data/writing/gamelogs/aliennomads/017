Nomad's chronicles - part 17

How could we not see?!


There is no special power in the monoliths.
They are not more powerful than a beautiful sunset or the first flower of the spring growing from under the snow.


It's the minds of the observers that wield the power.
And like the sunset or the flower, the monoliths are catalysts, ways to harness this power.


The whispers we heard around the first monolith were our own whispers. The ideas we had were our own ideas.
The power we felt was our own power, mingled and amplified by the presence of the monolith.


I know what to do now.
