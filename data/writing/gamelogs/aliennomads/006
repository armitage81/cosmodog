Nomad's chronicles - part 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We travelled between stars for a long time until we found a place to call our new home.
We set up our base here.
We continued our research.
The monolith was lost but its vision already sparked to our minds.
We wanted to rebuild it and to decrypt its message.


This world turned around its sun five times before we managed to construct the first replica of the monolith.
Many others followed.
But we felt no inspiration.
The replicas stood silent like soulless statues.


There would be no help. We were on our own.
