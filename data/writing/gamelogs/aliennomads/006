Nomad's chronicles - part 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We traveled from star to star and finally found a place to call our new home.
We set up our camp.
We continued our research.
The monolith had been lost but sparks of its visions had already jumped to our minds.
We would rebuild it and decipher its messages.


This world had turned five times around its sun before we managed to construct the first replica of the monolith.
Many others followed.
But we felt no inspiration.
The pillars just stood there, silent. Soulless statues.
