Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Men are stupid. They are controlled by pride and rage that suppress their reasoning. Men are not able to think. 


I am troubled. I lie restless at night and look at the sky until the bloodleaf potion takes effect and gifts me the grace of sleep. The dreams do not provide a solution to my problem.


My only son's Channan naming day was a week ago. He is now fifteen cycles old. Channan is proud. He goes hunting with the older men and wants to marry Saikka, the elder's daughter. He is the strongest young man in the whole town and determined to prove it in the yearly tournament and gain the honor of Goddess's smile.


I have to prevent it.
