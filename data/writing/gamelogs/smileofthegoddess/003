Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day of the tournament. Townspeople surrounded the arena in plain sight of Goddess's Pillar. Oiled bodies of the boys shone in the sun as they wrestled on the sand. One by one, losers left the ring. They hanged their heads, but I could see relief on their faces. The Goddess would not smile upon them.


As I feared, my son won all his duels and qualified for the final fight. His opponent will be Tarik. Channan is excited beyond measure. During the parental blessing ceremony he barely noticed me as I washed his scratches and gave him his bowl of water. He looked out for Saikka. But Saikka did not come.
