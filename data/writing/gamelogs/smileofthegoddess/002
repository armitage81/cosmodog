Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarik is Channan's best friend.
He and my son learned their first steps together.
With age came rivalry.
I see how both look at Saikka.
Tarik is a strong boy but he is no match for my son.
Saikka feels the same way.


The tournament will start soon.
As every year, townspeople are agitated and excited.
The boys exercise, eager to win.


The Goddess is watching them from her red dais. The expression of her face is alien and solemn.
She waits for the ritual to finish and for the victor to claim the prize - her smile.


I have to act.
