Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both boys positioned themselves and the fight started. Surprisingly to the most, Channan's domination failed to appear. My son seemed absent and tired. The powers were even, Tarik stood his ground. 


The rivals rolled on the sand, their muscles strained, embracing each other in wrestling hugs. Their groaning was the only sound in the tense silence of the crowd. That's why everyone looked around in the direction of a sudden high-pitched call:


- "Hold on, Tarik!"


Channan hesitated in disbelief for a second as he turned his head toward Saikka. That was enough for encouraged Tarik to throw my son backwards on the sand. He won the duel.


Men are stupid and proud. They want to prevail even if their prize is death. The Goddess will smile upon Tarik who gained the honor to approach the pillar and join his soul with her. My son, however, will live in shame with his hurt pride. But he will live. And one day he will be mature enough to read my notes and forgive my bowl of bloodleaf potion and Saikka's bluff that both saved his life.
