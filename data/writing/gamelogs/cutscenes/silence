Silence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Listen!"


Alisa's sudden remark gives you the creeps. You realize that you haven't hear anything but your steps and calls of some distant birds since you landed. "What's wrong? I don't hear anything."


"Oh, you finally got the hint. Good." 


It's just your broken assistant speaking but for a second you imagine a young lady rolling her eyes in view of your stupidity. "So quiet here," she says.


You look at the sharp edges of the mountains around you. "I don't know. The planet is off-limits. Perhaps, this part of it was never colonized."


"And who's built this road? Indigenous creatures? Giant worms, maybe? Or some other strange life forms?"


"Said a broken robot lady."


You feel the needle slightly pricking your backhand. 


"Jesus! Stop it!"


"You deserved it. You are very rude, darling. Next time I'll inject some serotonin." She seems to like the power of her newfound skill. "What are our next steps, by the way? Is there a plan?"


This lady is too emotional and too curious for her own good, you say to yourself.


"We are investigating."


"Investigating what?"


If you knew.


For a moment, you see Mary's face - not her usual pretty features, but a retarded mask with empty eyes and half-opened mouth, staring mindlessly at the red toy dog in front of her. You shake your head to chase the vision away.


"The road must get us somewhere. We should move on."


"Well, yes. Let's go." Alisa sighs. Yes, your portable assistant device sighs. Loud and clear, so you can't miss it. "And while you walk, dear, I'll enjoy my precious loneliness."


You almost feel sorry for her. Almost.


"Just call me Karl."
