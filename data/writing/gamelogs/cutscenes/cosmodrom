Cosmodrom
--------------------------------------------------------
You see a large complex of protruding buildings. A familiar view for a cargo pilot. Except this place is desolated beyond recognition.


"Jesus!" you mutter, astonished by the scale of the destruction.


"What?" Alisa demands. "What is there? Tell me!"


"Nothing. Just a destroyed space port!"


"You mean a COSMODROM?" she inquires. 


You shrug at her adjustment. "Whatever you call it. It is a place to send astronauts in space."


"You mean COSMONAUTS?" Alisa seems to take her supposed Russian roots damn seriously. You don't see a reason to argue.


"Yes, a place to send COSMONAUTS in... the COSMOS. In any case; the place is desolated. Must be a launch failure."


"Or another fight," Alisa remarks. "Let's see if we can find something useful here."
