Memory of the neighbour girl
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This time, it's a memory of the neighbour girl you had a crush on when you were twelve. She always wore checked dresses and had long blonde hair that glowed in the morning sun when she went outside to get the newspaper for her parents. You watched her through the door window, standing behind the curtains. What was her name? you think. You don't remember.


This bothers you even after the memory fades. How could you forget her name? You were really into the girl that summer, not knowing, why, following her like a shadow until her dad has been relocated to another station and they left the city.


"What was her name?" you say to yourself, irritated. "I whispered it a thousand times into my pillow. It was important to me."


"It was long ago," Aisa responses, musing. "You are lucky to have anything to remember, at least." 


After a pause she asks, "say, Karl, would you remember my name if I'd be gone."


"Of course, Eleanor."


"Very funny," she snarls.


You leave the monolith behind, contemplating. The empty spot in your memory stings you like a sharp splint. Then Alisa breaks the silence.


"The girl's name was Helen."


You slap your palm on your forehead.


She is right.
