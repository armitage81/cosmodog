Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind wafts around you with the same sudden vehemency as before, but this time you are prepared. As the whispers approach you in the star-sprinkled darkness you don't fight them. You listen, carefully, eager to remember.


The memory is about the day you first met Mary. AIV chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site. The flight was long and eventless. You remember her sitting in front of the window, looking at the stars. Your first casual talk. A short discussion about the purpose of xenoarchaeology. You wonder why this science has put so much effort in the discipline that had studied ancient past and Mary argues that archaeology is not about the past but about predicting the future. Feeling a sudden urge to impress her with your cleverness, you mention that with astrology there is already such a science. Mary smiles at the joke and your heart makes a jump.



"So romantic," sounds Alisa's voice from your wrist when the vision is over. "Give me a handkerchief, honey."


"Very funny", you snarl. "How come you know about the visions?"


"I just sense them, like you do," she says casually.


"But those memories are mine. The monoliths cause them. I hallucinate. You can't "sense" hallucinations. You're a machine."


Alisa laughs a weird laugh. "Don't judge others based on their appearance, Karl. Sometimes, there is much more to a person than seems at first."


You halt and inspect the broken assistant device. This glitch goes way too far.


And why does the voice sound so familiar!?
