Ghost Town
-------------------------------------------------------
You breath a sigh of relief as you see first signs of a human settlement. 


"Finally, a town!"


But your gladness doesn't last long. You examine the burnt building nearby and understand that the uneasy feeling of lonelyness still lingers in the atmosphere. 


"It's abandoned," you say. "What happened here?"


Alisa is glad to help. "I register smoke and a little share of radiation in the air. This place was hit by bombs. How barbaric!"


You look at the rubble and ashes around you. "It must have happened not so long ago. Did we end up in a war zone?"


"This gives me the creeps," Alisa says with a frightened voice. Is she actually able to fret? You feel a motoric vibration from the computer on your wrist. Is it supposed to represent shivering? Alisa is for sure a drama queen. 


"Let's look around."
