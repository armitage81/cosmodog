Entering the base
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa told the truth. As you execute the instructions she gave you, the seal breaks and the portal that was shut since thousands of years opens. 


A gust of warm air blows from the inside of the alien structure across your face. Chains of red lights blink along the violet walls and on luminiscent machines as if the inhabitants of the base left just yesterday. The slick tiles of unknown substance are clean and adorned with regular patterns. Whispering voices surround you as in one of the visions. The local source of the field is somewhere close.


You step inside, hesitantly. Looking at the assistant device, you notice the battery indicator turning from yellow to red. You straighten, determined to reach the source and to confront Mary as soon as possible. Alisa doesn't have much time left. 


"Hold on, dear," you say. "We're almost there."
