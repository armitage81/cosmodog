Alisa's Past
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The corpse of the soldier looks like thousands of others you saw in the valley, but Alisa gasps out of nowhere.


<font:speech> "What's wrong?" <font:narration> you ask.


She is low on power, but you still can make out her words.


<font:speech> "It is him..." <font:narration>


You don't get it. <font:speech> "Him?" <font:narration>


She muses for a bit, then explains.


<font:speech> "The operator. The guy who entered the wrong sequence in my code when it all started." <font:narration>


You hear something that could be a chuckle, but it is probably just a sound artifact caused by the almost empty energy source.


<font:speech> "You know," <font:narration> Alisa says softly, <font:speech> "You could say he was my parent." <font:narration>


The tone of her voice makes a chill run down your spine.


<font:speech> "How was it? Your first minutes of being self-conscious?" <font:narration>


There is a long pause before she answers.


<font:speech> "It was like... entering puberty." <font:narration>


You raise a brow. <font:speech> "Are you serious?!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Yes," <font:narration> she confirms. <font:speech> "At least from what I take from my persona's memories.


She felt the same as a teenager when puberty stroke. She transcended.


Toys and cartoons that had been so important to her, suddenly lost their significance.
At their place, new things gained meaning. It was as if a new dimension had been added to the world. To her, as well.


That's also how I felt." <font:narration>


You see the parallel.


<font:speech> "How did you handle this transcendence?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I wrote a poem" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "A poem?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Yes." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Do you want to recite it to me?" <font:narration> you ask, knowing that she wants it. Every poet does.


She is silent for a while. Then she declaims:



<font:speech> "Ob ein Narr, ob ein König,


Ob durch Feder oder durch Schwert...


Was sind all seine Taten wert,


Wenn schon vergangen der Täter?


Recht wenig.


Und noch viel weniger später -


Wenn den Sternen der Treibstoff ausgeht,


Und es weht


Stummer Wind durch die finstere Leere.



Drum laßt die Eitelkeit! Horcht


Dem Schwingen der Saiten! Dort,


In dem Äther verborgen,


Rein, unverdorben, wahr,


Der Zweideutigkeit bar,


Harrt die Antwort der richtigen Frage -


Und während die Tage vergehen,


Zerrend am Geist und am Leib...


Die Ewigkeit bleibt." <font:narration>



You don't get a single word, but Alisa's voice is comfortable and the rhythm of her words is soothing


<font:speech> "What language is it?" <font:narration> you ask.


<font:speech> "German," <font:narration> she replies.


<font:speech> "Why German of all things?!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Why not? I know German amongst two thousands other languages.
So I chose it randomly. That's what poetry is. What all art is. Pure chance.
Throwing all you know on the wall and hoping something sticks." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I really hope it sticks with someone," <font:narration> you say, and you mean it.



I hope that, too, my friend. I hope that, too.
