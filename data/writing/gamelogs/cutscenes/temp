My name is Karl Novak. Here I stand, such as I am. An imperfect being. Tired. Afraid. Hurt. I do not know what the future holds. I do not know the universal Truth. But I stand here and now, and I am aware of it. In the endless space, among billions of others, I know who I am and I know what I want.

The Universe may be vast and void and intimidating. The bigger is my triumpgh of just being here and knowing that. While stars are dimming I hold the torch, and my fire shines bright. I am on par with everything that is, albeit only for a while.

Come with me, Mary. Let's burn this air with our breath. Let's stamp this soil with our feet. Let's leave our marks in this world. Hold my hand. Feel its warmth.
