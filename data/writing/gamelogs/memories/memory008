Corn flakes and apple jam
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:speech> "My god! It was disgusting!!!" <font:narration> 


Your last memory made Alisa very upset. 


<font:speech> "Now I know everything about you, Karl, you pig!" <font:narration>


You feel your face glowing. 


<font:speech> "I was thirteen, goddammit!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "That's your excuse!? I'm nauseated!" <font:narration>


You stand there, blushing, angry with Alisa. 
What business does she have with your childhood? It is private!


Acting on impulse, you unbuckle the assistant device from your wrist and hurl it 
against the monolith. 
Alisa's voice stops abruptly as the device hits its surface.
Instantly, you sense a feeling of regret... and something else.


Loneliness.


What if you damaged Alisa? What if she went silent forever? 


You dash to the place where the device landed and pick it up. 


<font:speech> "Alisa? Alisa! I'm sorry! Say something!" <font:narration>


The blank screen stares at you for a while, 
then Alisa replies in a weak voice: <font:speech> "I'm afraid, Karl... 
My mind is going... I can feel it..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Alisa, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..." <font:narration>


At once, you understand what she is doing. 
The realization leaves you annoyed and relieved at the same time.


<font:speech> "Stupid robobrain!" <font:narration>


She chuckles as you put the device back on your wrist. 


<font:speech> "Got you! Come on, admit it, you were worried about me. You like me, Karl, admit it!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Not at all! You are a little annoying harpy. You just laughed at my childhood memory." <font:narration>


She produces a disgusted grunt. 


<font:speech> "But it was abominable! Who on Earth eats CORN FLAKES with APPLE JAM? It's gross!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I told you I was thirteen... and it was delicious!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You don't have much taste, do you?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I do have taste, okay?! So hold your tongue! Oh, wait, you don't have any!" <font:narration>


Alisa chuckles.


<font:speech> "Touch√©." <font:narration>


She goes silent for a second, then says: 


<font:speech> "I like you, too, Karl." <font:narration>
