Corn flakes and apple jam
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:speech> "My god! What was THIS memory about?!" <font:narration> 


Alisa seems disgusted after seing your latest memory. 


<font:speech> "Now I know everything about you, Karl, you pig!" <font:narration>


You feel your face glowing. 


<font:speech> "I was thirteen, goddammit!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "That's your excuse!? I'm nauseated!" <font:narration>


You stand there, blushing, angry with Alisa. How can she see all this? What business does she have with your childhood? It is private!


Then your anger turns against yourself. Why do you even bother? She is a program, a piece of software! Why do you care what she sees and what not? The software is not even working properly. In her state and with the injection needles, "Alisa" could even pose a threat to your life. Why do you carry "her" along, anyway?


Acting on impulse, you quickly unstrap the assistant device from your wrist and hurl it against the monolith. Alisa's voice, still commenting, stops abruptly as the device hits the slick red surface and falls to the ground. Instantly, you sense a feeling of regret... and something else.


Loneliness.


You realize that you might be the only conscious being in the valley, perhaps even on the whole planet. The pressure of silence around you lets you quiver. 


What if you damaged Alisa? What if she went silent forever? 


You dash to the place where the device landed and pick it up. 


<font:speech> "Alisa? Alisa! I'm sorry! Say something!" <font:narration>


The blank screen stares at you for a while, then Alisa replies in a weak voice: <font:speech> "I'm afraid, Karl... My mind is going... I can feel it..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Alisa, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..." <font:narration>


At once, you understand what she is doing. The realization leaves you relieved and annoyed at the same time.


<font:speech> "Stupid robobrain!" <font:narration>


She chuckles as you strap the device on again. 


<font:speech> "Got you! Come on, admit it, you were worried about me. You like me, Karl, admit it." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Not at all. You are a little annoying harpy. You just laughed at my childhood memory." <font:narration>


She makes a disgusted grunt. 


<font:speech> "But it was disgusting! Who puts corn flakes in the apple jam, anyway? It's gross!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I told you I was thirteen... and it was delicious!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You don't have much taste, do you?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I do have taste, okay?! So hold your tongue! Oh, wait, you don't have any!" <font:narration>


Alisa chuckles.


<font:speech> "Touche." <font:narration>


She goes silent for a second, then says: 


<font:speech> "I like you, too, Karl." <font:narration>
