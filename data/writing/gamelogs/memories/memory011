Flight over the ocean
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:memory> You wait, gazing into the darkness and listening to the whispers, yet nothing occurs.
You look around but there is no one to be seen. You are alone. Blind. Floating on thin air. 
A sudden rush of panic makes your heart pound against your ribs.
You whirl, arms spread, feeling around but unable to find anything to grasp. It is terrifying.


<font:speech> "Dad!" <font:memory>


A firm grip takes hold of your arm. You feel a strong hand on your shoulder. 


<font:speech> "Don't worry, Karl, you can do it." <font:memory>


Father puts your palm back on the flight stick. 
A feeling of safety and security overcomes you. 
You open your eyes and take in the view behind the cockpit.
The waves of the ocean below reach to the curved horizon, 
their tiny foam crests still a frightening indicator of the high altitude.
But you are not afraid. Not anymore. 


With Dad here, protecting you, nothing can go wrong.


You carefully move the flight stick, guiding the transporter into a gentle leftward curve, tilting the horizon.
A sudden turbulence rocks the vessel but you manage to straighten the course and direct the transporter 
toward the thin coastline.


<font:speech> "Good job, Karl," <font:memory> dad laughs and pats your shoulder.
<font:speech> "You'll be a great pilot one day!" <font:memory>


<font:speech> "As good as you?" <font:memory> you gasp, excited.


<font:speech> "Maybe," <font:memory> he says.
<font:speech> "Maybe better. That is, if you train hard enough." <font:memory>


<font:speech> "I will!" <font:memory>


You turn to see dad's face but it eludes you. 


The ocean seems endless.
The waves fill the whole view, a shimmering turquoise carpet.
Somewhere, at the edge of your consciousness, you hear the cry again, 
but this time it is distant and not able to distract you. You know, you will fly forever.



Suddenly, dad's hand clutches at your wrist, piercing fingernails into your skin.


Screaming in pain, you drag your hand away and spin around. 


Dad is not here anymore. You are alone, high above the ocean. 
The panic is back. Blood is dripping from your injured hand. 
The cry grows louder as you lose control of the transporter. It tilts its nose toward the waves.
You grip the flight stick with both hands and pull at it but you are not strong enough. 
The ocean pushes the sky out of sight and spreads, spinning, all over the cockpit view. 
You close your eyes in front of the impending collision.



<font:narration> Silence.


You open your eyes and see a red tower looming over you. You try to stand up and fail. Your legs are numb. There is a blood stain on your left hand.


You can hardly believe your eyes.


<font:speech> "You... you drugged me." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Oh, thank God!" <font:narration> Alisa responds anxiously. 
<font:speech> "I thought I'd lost you. You fell and your pulse slowed down. 
I didn't know what to do. Thought you will go, like all the others. 
So I decided to sedate you." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I did not ask for your help!" <font:narration>


Alisa seems genuinely offended.


<font:speech> "What are you talking about? You were almost gone! 
How are you supposed to finish your investigation if you lose your mind?!" <font:narration>


Your fingers itch as life returns to your limbs.


<font:speech> "What? Investigation?" <font:narration> you cough. 


She got you wrong. Completely wrong. You chuckle bitterly.


<font:speech> "I am not here to investigate." <font:narration>  


<font:speech> "Why else are you here then?" <font:narration> Alisa asks.


<font:speech> "To join." <font:narration>


With a strain you sit up.


<font:speech> "You stopped me from joining Mary." <font:narration>
