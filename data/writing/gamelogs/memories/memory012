Women
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standing before the monolith, you remove the assistant device from your wrist. Alisa is offended by the mistrust.


<font:speech> "No need for it, darling. I won't save you anymore if you don't want it. Do what you must. Throw your life away. Leave me here alone." <font:narration>


After a pause she adds softly: <font:speech> "Still think it's wrong, though." <font:narration>


The memory is dark. It's one of those days after your breakup. The vision does not hold long. You hear the cry and fail. Again.


Back in the real world, you lean against the now silent monolith, close your eyes and take deep breaths.


<font:speech> "Say, Karl, what was in that letter?" <font:narration> Alisa asks.


<font:speech> "What letter?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "The one you wrote to Mary and then tore apart. What was in it?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I do not even remember. Just some sentimental trash." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You should've given it to her." <font:narration>


You shrug. <font:speech> "Don't think so. It wouldn't be in Mary's interest." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I understand," <font:narration> Alisa responds. Her voice clearly contradicts her statement. 
You sigh. She is in a fighting mood.


The AI confirms your suspicion by saying: <font:speech> "Tell me, Karl, what do you know about women?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Obviously, not enough. But you will teach me," <font:narration> you respond wryly.


<font:speech> "I will," <font:narration> she agrees, ignoring the sarcasm.
<font:speech> "Lesson number one: You can't expect a woman to make the first step, dear." <font:narration>


You shake your head.


<font:speech> "Come on! Which century do you come from? The twentieth?" <font:narration>


Alisa's accent intensifies. 


<font:speech> "Don't get me wrong. 
Passivity is a strength in this case, not a weakness!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "How so?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> Well, it's all about strategic patience.


You see, women don't just chase after random opportunities, blind and stubborn, like men do. 
Instead, women wait. They wait until they get enough alternatives. And then they choose the best one. 
Rationally. This is a strength you guys should envy us for." <font:narration> 


<font:speech> "Okay, okay." <font:narration> You raise your hands wearily. <font:speech> "I got you now. I should have bought a white stallion and a shining armor,
and rescue Mary from her boring research work." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "At least you should've provided her with this option! Would she choose it? I don't know.
But I know that she never got an opportunity to choose. That's what drives me crazy!" <font:narration>


You stiffen as her words let blood rush to your head. 
Enraged, you clench the fists and open your mouth to say something that would counter Alisa's argument and prove you right.


Nothing comes to your mind. 


After a while you relax and breathe out. 


<font:speech> "What's done is done. It's all in the past now." <font:narration>


Alisa does not answer.
