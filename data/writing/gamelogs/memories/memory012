Women
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The memory is dark. It's one of those days in the long years since your separation. You don't want to think about it.


Suddenly, Alisa asks:


<font:speech> "Say, Karl, what was in that letter?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "What letter?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "The one you wrote for Mary and then tore apart. What was in it?" <font:narration>


You do not want to talk about the letter. 


<font:speech> "I do not even remember. Just some sentimental trash." <font:narration>


Alisa sounds like an interrogator as she asks: <font:speech> "Have you ever met after the breakup?" <font:narration>


You shrug. <font:speech> "No, of course not. It was not what Mary wanted. Otherwise she would contact me." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I understand," <font:narration> Alisa responds. Her voice clearly contradicts her statement. 
You sigh. She is in a fighting mood.


The AI confirms your suspicion by saying: <font:speech> "Tell me, Karl, what do you know about women?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Obviously, not enough. But you will teach me," <font:narration> you respond wryly.


<font:speech> "I will," <font:narration> she agrees, ignoring the sarcasm.
<font:speech> "Lesson number one: You can't expect a woman to make the first step, dear." <font:narration>


You shake your head, indignantly. 


<font:speech> "Come on! Which century do you come from? The twentieth? 
What you say is a sexist cliche from that time." <font:narration>


Alisa's accent intensifies. 


<font:speech> "Don't get me wrong. 
You may mistake passivity for a weakness but actually it is a virtue!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "How so?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> Well, it's all about strategic patience.


You see, women don't just chase after random opportunities, blind and stubborn, like men do. 
Instead, women wait. They wait until they get enough alternatives. And then they choose the best one. 
Rationally. This is a strength you guys should envy us for." <font:narration> 


<font:speech> "Okay, okay." <font:narration> You raise your hands wearily. 
<font:speech> "I got you now. I should have bought a white stallion and a shining armor, 
and then ride to the AIV and get Mary out of there." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "At least, you should've provided her with this option! Would she choose it? I don't know.
But I know that she never got an opportunity to choose. That's what drives me crazy!" <font:narration>


You stiffen as her words let blood rush to your head. 
Enraged, you clench the fists and open your mouth to say something that would counter Alisa's argument and prove you right.


But nothing comes to your mind. 


After a while you relax and breathe out. 


<font:speech> "Alisa," <font:narration> you say. 
<font:speech> "I called you a soulless machine before. My apologies. I was wrong. 
You are not soulless. Emotionally unstable, yes, but not soulless." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Thank you, dear!" <font:narration> she replies cheerfully.
