Women
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:speech> "It was the letter, wasn't it?" <font:narration> Alisa asks cautiously as you awake, a grim expression on your face. <font:speech> "The memory. It was about the farewell note?" <font:narration>


You do not want to talk about the letter. You never got over it, not after seven years. 


<font:speech> "Hmm," <font:narration> you mutter evasively.


Alisa sounds like an interrogator as she asks: <font:speech> "have you ever met afterwards?" <font:narration>


You shrug. <font:speech> "No, of course not. Mary clearly stated that it was not what she wanted." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I understand," <font:narration> Alisa responds. Her voice clearly contradicts her statement. You sigh. She is in a fighting mood.


The AI confirms your suspicion by saying: <font:speech> "Tell me, Karl, what do you know about women?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Obviously, not enough. But you will teach me," <font:narration> you say wryly.


<font:speech> "I will," <font:narration> she agrees, not noticing the irony. <font:speech> "Lesson number one: Women are passive. You can't expect a woman to make the first step, dear." <font:narration>


You shake your head, indignantly. 


<font:speech> "Come on! Which century were you built in? The twentieth? What you say is a sexist cliche from that time." <font:narration>


Alisa's accent intensifies. 


<font:speech> "Don't get me wrong. You may mistake passivity for a weakness but actually it is a virtue of patience. Women don't just chase after random opportunities, blind and stubborn, like men do. Instead, women wait. They wait until they get enough alternatives. And then they choose the best one. Rationally. This is a strength you guys should envy us for. Even if, sometimes, waiting turns out painful and takes way too long." <font:narration> 


Her last words almost sound like an accusation.


<font:speech> "Okay, okay." <font:narration> You raise your hands wearily. <font:speech> "I got you. I should have bought a white stallion and a shining armor and then I would ride to the AIV and get Mary out of there." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "At least, you should've provided her this alternative! Should've given her the choice which she never got!" <font:narration>


You stiffen as her words let blood rush to your head. Enraged, you clench the fists and open your mouth to say something that would destroy Alisa's argument and prove you right. 


But nothing comes to your mind. 


After a while you relax and breathe out. 


<font:speech> "Alisa," <font:narration> you say. <font:speech> "I called you a soulless machine before. My apologies. I was wrong. You are not soulless. Emotionally unstable, yes, but not soulless." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Thank you, dear!" <font:narration> she replies.
