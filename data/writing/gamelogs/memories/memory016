The cry
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is as usual. The gusting wind tears at your flesh as you touch the monolith. You hear whispers. The darkness surrounds you. The memory is about Mary. Again. But something is different. Tears are dropping from Mary's cheeks. But it cannot be a memory of yours. It feels wrong. Mary is the strongest person you ever met. Seeing her, helpless and tearful, is a dissonance that makes the vision lucid. You wake up, open your eyes and sit down, leaning your back on the monolith's surface.


Alisa is surprised by your sudden return. 


<font:speech> "That was fast," <font:narration> she says. <font:speech> "What happened?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I don't know." <font:narration> You shake your head. <font:speech> "You know... Mary... She did it on purpose. She... her mind is here. It stays within the field. Her consciousness is here but..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "But what?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I cannot reach her. It is as if something would try to stop me from joining her." <font:narration>


Alisa contemplates for a moment then says: <font:speech> "What if Mary herself doesn't want you to join her." <font:narration>


You do not answer. Her words sting you. But what if she is right? How can you expect Mary to wait for you after all those years and events? What do you hope for, man? What are you doing here?


You wearily put your head in your palms.
