The cry
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is as usual. The gusting wind tears at your flesh as you touch the monolith. You hear whispers. The darkness surrounds you. The memory is about Mary. Again. But something is different. Tears are dropping from Mary's cheeks. She is weeping. Her silent cry stands out from the millions of whispering voices. It is the same sound that you heard in the other visions. But it cannot be a memory of yours. You never saw Mary crying. It feels wrong. She is the strongest person you ever met. Seeing her, helpless and tearful, is a dissonance that makes the vision even more lucid than her cry did. You wake up, open your eyes and sit down, leaning your back on the monolith's surface.


Alisa is surprised by your sudden return. "That was fast," she says. "What happened?"


"I don't know." You shake your head. "You know, I read Mary's journal. She did it on purpose. She... her mind is here. It stays within the field. Her consciousness is here but..."


"But what?"


"I can't reach her. This cry. It doesn't let me. It is as if something would try to stop me from joining her."


Alisa contemplates for a moment then says, "or it's Mary herself who doesn't want you to join her."


You don't answer. Her words sting you. But what if she is right? How can you expect Mary to wait for you after all those years and events? What do you hope for, man? What are you doing here?


You wearily put your head in your palms.
