The cry
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is as usual. 


The gusting wind tears at your skin as you touch the monolith. 
You hear whispers. 
The darkness surrounds you. 


You see Mary. But can it really be her? 


Tears are dropping from Mary's cheeks. It feels wrong. Mary is the strongest person you ever met. 
Seeing her crying is a dissonance that makes the vision lucid. 
You wake up, open your eyes and lean your back against the monolith's surface.


Alisa is surprised by your sudden return. 


<font:speech> "That was fast," <font:narration> she says. <font:speech> "What happened?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I don't know." <font:narration> 


You shake your head. 


<font:speech> "You know... Mary... Her mind is still here, I'm sure of it. But..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "But what?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I cannot reach her. This cry. It prevents me from uniting with her." <font:narration>


Alisa contemplates for a moment then says: 
<font:speech> "What if Mary herself doesn't want you to join her." <font:narration>


You do not answer. Alisa's words sting. But what if she is right? 
How can you expect Mary to wait for you after all those years? 
What do you hope for, man? What are you doing here?


You wearily put your head in your palms.
