Defiance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cry is there again. It drives you out of the vision in seconds.

 
Suddenly, you feel anger rising within you. Why is Mary so stubborn? Why is she controlling your actions?
It is your own life! You decide what you do with it! Not Mary! Not anyone else! You alone!


On impulse, you kick the monolith's footing, sharp pain shooting through your toe.


<font:speech> "Damn it! I'll do it whether you want it or not, you hear me?" <font:narration>


The assistant device vibrates slightly and you raise it to your ear. 


<font:speech> "What?!" <font:narration>


Alisa's voice is even softer than before. <font:speech> "I know a way," <font:narration> she whispers.


You blink, disconcerted. 


<font:speech> "What do you mean?" <font:narration>


She stays silent for ten seconds as if gathering strength, then continues: 
<font:speech> "The alien base... It's the source... It's where the local field is strongest... 
You must go there." <font:narration>


You frown. <font:speech> "But you told me it is sealed." <font:narration>


Her answer is barely audible. <font:speech>


"I know... I know how to open it... " <font:narration> 


You look at the device incredulously. 


<font:speech> "Why haven't you told me before?" <font:narration> you gasp.


<font:speech> "I felt you weren't ready yet," <font:narration> she replies weakly. 


<font:speech> "Not ready?! Not ready for what?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "To understand what you really want." <font:narration> 


<font:speech> "And now? Do I understand what I want now?" <font:narration> 


Her voice is so silent that you cannot decipher the response.
But you don't need to. You know the answer.


...



You complied, your whole life.
Behaved, trying to be a good boy, looking up to your role models, idolizing your father, and Mary,
and those island explorers. Always following. Always doubting yourself.


Until you met Alisa. 


She showed you a new way of thinking. Helped you uncover a behavioral pattern buried within you all those years. A pattern that developed with each vision, fed on your conversations.
It made you strong, cleared your mind, a tool necessary to end it all.


Defiance.
