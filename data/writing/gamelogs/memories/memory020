Ready to make own decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cry is there again. It pushes you out of the vision before you can realize which memory it represents. It drives you crazy. You feel angry with Mary. Why is she so stubborn? Why is she controlling your actions? It is your own life. You decide what you do with it. Not Mary. Not anyone else. You alone!

On a sudden impulse, you kick the monolith's footing and feel sharp pain piercing your toe. 


<font:speech> "Damn it! I'll do it whether you want it or not, you hear me?" <font:narration> you shout at the monolith, blinded with rage.


The assistant device vibrates slightly and you raise it to your ear. <font:speech> "What?" <font:narration>


Alisa's voice is even quieter than before. <font:speech> "I know a way," <font:narration> Alisa whispers.


You blink, disconcerted. <font:speech> "Which way?" <font:narration>


She stays silent for ten seconds as if gathering strength, then continues: <font:speech> "The local center of the field... The alien base... It's the source... It's where the field is strongest... You must go there." <font:narration>


You frown. <font:speech> "The structure is sealed. Even SUF could not enter it in all those years." <font:narration>


You hardly hear her answer, <font:speech> "I know... I know how to open it." <font:narration> 


You look at the device incredulously, as Alisa explains how to unseal the portal. 


<font:speech> "Why did you not tell me before?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You weren't ready yet," <font:narration> she replies weakly. <font:speech> "Now, you are ready." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Ready?" <font:narration> 


You do not understand. You spent days wandering across the valley, fighting and failing, and she knew the solution all along? 


<font:speech> "Ready for what?" <font:narration>


Her voice is so silent that you don't know whether you hear or imagine the answer.


<font:speech> "For making your own decision." <font:narration>
