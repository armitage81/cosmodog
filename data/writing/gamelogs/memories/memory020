Ready to make own decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cry is there again. It drives you out of the vision in seconds.

 
Suddenly, you feel getting angry. Why is Mary so stubborn? Why is she controlling your actions? 
It is your own life! You decide what you do with it! Not Mary! Not anyone else! You alone!


On a spontaneous impulse, you kick the monolith's footing and feel sharp pain piercing your toe. 


<font:speech> "Damn it! I'll do it whether you want it or not, you hear me?" <font:narration>


The assistant device vibrates slightly and you raise it to your ear. 


<font:speech> "What?!" <font:narration>


Alisa's voice is even softer than before. <font:speech> "I know a way," <font:narration> she whispers.


You blink, disconcerted. 


<font:speech> "What do you mean?" <font:narration>


She stays silent for ten seconds as if gathering strength, then continues: 
<font:speech> "The alien base... It's the source... It's where the local field is strongest... 
You must go there." <font:narration>


You frown. <font:speech> "But you told me that it is sealed. Even SUF could not enter it in all those years." <font:narration>


You hardly hear her answer, <font:speech> 


"I know... I know how to open it... I learned..." <font:narration> 


You look at the device incredulously, as Alisa explains the sequence that should unseal the base portal. 


<font:speech> "But how do you know?" <font:narration> you wonder.


<font:speech> "I saw... I saw her... doing it." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Who?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Mary." <font:narration>


You cannot believe your ears. Mary? In the alien base? So that's why she came here!


<font:speech> "Why didn't you tell me before?" <font:narration> you whisper.


<font:speech> "I felt you weren't ready yet," <font:narration> she replies weakly. <font:speech> "You were missing an important tool needed to confront Mary and the field. I think you got it now." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "A tool?" <font:narration> 


You do not understand. 
You spent days wandering across the valley, fighting and failing, trying desperately to join Mary and Alisa knew the solution all along? 


<font:speech> "Which tool?" <font:narration>


Her voice is so silent that you cannot decipher the answer. But you don't need to. You suddenly understand. You know which tool Alisa means. You missed it your whole life. Lacked it by trying to be a good guy, by looking up to your role models, by idolyzing your father, and Mary, and those hot air balloon travellers. Always following. Always doubting yourself. But now it's there. You feel it. A skill that gradually developed within you during your journey, became more powerfull with each vision. It made you strong, let your head think clearly. It is the necessary perk for everyone who wants to make things right. The attribute of champions. The state of mind that will allow you to stand up to the Universe. 


Defiance.
