The child
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At first it seems as if nothing had changed when you touch the monolith.
Then you realize that your body is made of glass.
Gray floor tiles are visible through your body, and you can see the walls of the room through your arms.


You flinch, startled, and the sudden movement causes a crack to form in your chest. It hurts.


The feeling is all too familiar. Anguish. Uncertainty. Self-doubt.


Fragility.


A portal is activated on a white pillar in front of you.
Just as you focus your eyes on it, a presence disappears behind the portal.


<font:speech> "Don't go!" <font:narration>


You run toward the portal and hear the sound of cracking glass coming up from your feet. Why do they leave?
Why do they run? What's wrong with you that they abandon you?


You dive through the portal and appear on the other side just to see the contour of the runaway jumping through the other portal.
The silhouette is vague, blurry. You don't know who the person is, but you know you have to reach them. Stop them from running and show them there is nothing to fear. Cracks are spreading through your whole body as you move, an unbearable torture.


<font:speech> "Wait, damn it!" <font:narration>


You follow the escapee, traversing one portal after the other. Every time, the blurry presence stays one step ahead, vanishing through the next portal before you can see it clearly.


At one point you understand that you never left the chamber.
Every portal brought you back to the other end of the same room. A sudden realization strikes you...


Reaching the next portal, you stop halfway through.
A part of your body is already on the other side. You understand. The silhouette you saw was your own back. Your own body. Only... it is not made of glass.
It is not even a body of a grown man. It is a little child. A boy.


<font:speech> "Don't be afraid," <font:narration> you whisper.


Reluctantly, the boy turns around, facing you.
You see stains of dried tears on his cheeks. His eyes are full of fear.


You make a step forward, expecting him to run away, but the boy stands still, waiting.


<font:speech> "It's okay," <font:narration> you say soothingly, approaching the boy. <font:speech> "Everything is okay." <font:narration>


The boy flinches as you touch his shoulder. You kneel down in front of him and look in his face.


<font:speech> "There is nothing to fear," <font:narration> you say. <font:speech> "You're doing fine.
I know that you are doing your best, you hear?" <font:narration>


The boy does not answer.


<font:speech> "I know it's not always easy, and there are so many things in this world that are wrong, and false, and intimidating, but you will manage. Somehow you will manage. Always." <font:narration>


You want to tell him more, so much more, but instead you just firmly hug the boy. His whole body is tense at first, but then it relaxes and suddenly the boy hugs you back with all his force.


You sit there for a long time, holding the boy in your arms, sharing your strength with him, and drawing strength from his, feeling the cracks mend.


Then you wake up in front of the red monolith.


In reality, your body is not made of glass. It's firm and solid and capable of achieving much.


You stand up and whisper: <font:speech> "I'm really proud of you, my boy." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "What did you say?" <font:narration> Alisa asks.


You smile.


<font:speech> "Nothing. Just talking to myself."
