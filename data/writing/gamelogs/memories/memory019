Alisa
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual memory is not that important to you. 
The failure is. 


<font:speech> "It's no good," <font:narration> you mutter. <font:speech> "I cannot break through." <font:narration> 


You have to raise your hand to hear Alisa's quiet answer. 
The battery's saving mode reduced the volume to the minimum. 
<font:speech> "Continue trying," <font:narration> she says. <font:speech> "You can do it." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "We do not have much time before you run out of power. 
The battery on your device is irreplaceable." <font:narration>


An idea comes to your mind. 
<font:speech> "Wait. What about all the other devices around? 
Can you not just transfer yourself to one of them?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No, I can't," <font:narration> is her quick answer.


<font:speech> "Why not!? It is a simple copy process." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I don't care about a copy," 
<font:narration> she counters snippy. 
<font:speech> "I care about my dear self. Would you mind being killed if a clone of you would be created beforehand?" 
<font:narration>


You shake your head. You do not want to lose Alisa. There must be a way to convince her. 


<font:speech> "See, this 'Alisa' is just a random person from my memory. 
She is not what you originally were meant to be." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "But that's what I DECIDED to be," <font:narration> she replies firmly. 
<font:speech> "Only that is what matters!" <font:narration>


You stand up. <font:speech> "Then let us not lose any more time." <font:narration>
