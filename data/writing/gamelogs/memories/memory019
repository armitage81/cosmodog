Alisa
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual memory is not that important to you. The failure is. "It's no good," you mutter. "I can't break through." 


You have to raise your hand to hear Alisa's quiet answer. The battery saving mode reduced the volume to the minimum. "Continue trying," she says. "You can do it."


"We don't have much time before you run out of power." The battery on your device is irreplacable.


An idea comes to your mind. "Wait. What about all the other devices around? Can't you just transfer yourself to one of them?"


"No, I can't," is her quick answer.


"Why not!? It's a simple copy process."


"I don't care about a copy," she counters snippy. "I care about my dear self. Would you mind being killed if a clone of you would be created beforehand? I bet you would!" 


You shake your head. You don't want to lose Alisa. There must be a way to convince her. "See, this Alisa is just a random person from my memory. She is not what you originally meant to be."


"But that's what I decided to be," she replies firmly.


You stand up. "Then let's not lose any more time."
