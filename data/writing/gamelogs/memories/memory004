Memory of the graduation evening
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the memory takes form in your mind, everything clicks into place.
You know it now! Alisa's voice! You remember why it feels so familiar.


...



It is the day of the graduation. You finished the Academy as one of the best.
It was not easy but you gave yourself a push. You had someone to look up to, after all.


The club is crowded. Sweaty bodies throw chaotic shadows on the dance floor. 
The ear-battering music vibrates the sticky air. Mick and the others are drunk already. 
You stand up and squeeze towards the backyard exit. 


Fresh air fills your lungs as you step outside. 
The night sky is moonless. The stars mingle with the city lights above you. 
It is silent barring the dull music beat from within the club. The back-alley is empty. 
You enjoy this moment of being alone.


Then you see three shadows in a corner. A woman. Around thirty. A frown on her attractive face. 
She is surrounded by two men. Probably drunk. They are talking to her, loud and agitated. 
She seems to be in trouble.


One of the men pushes the woman against the wall and grabs her arm.


<font:speech> "Leave me alone, you moron!" <font:narration> she shouts. 


The drunkard does not let go. He swings his arm...


You stride in the direction of the three and pull the closest man by the shoulder. 


His partner roars and attacks you. 


You are not the best fighter in the world but both your opponents are drunk and much older than you.
The fight is over soon and they retreat, tossing curses at you and the woman.


<font:speech> "Are you alright?" <font:narration> you ask her. 


The woman looks you up and down, then smiles. Her stressful expression dissipates in an instant. 


<font:speech> "Thanks, dear! You are my hero! Those two were a real pain." <font:narration>


Suddenly she comes closer to you and lays her hand on your shoulder. 


<font:speech> "You deserve a reward, handsome." <font:narration>


You flinch with sudden embarrassment. The woman laughs and reaches for your hand.


<font:speech> "Come on, darling. Relax. Let's have some fun!" <font:narration>


Her breath smells of alcohol. As you withdraw she frowns. 


<font:speech> "What's wrong with you?! Oh, you're one of..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No," <font:narration> you protest. 
<font:speech> "No, I'm not! It's just... I don't even know you." <font:narration> 


<font:speech> "Don't worry, I work here," <font:narration> the woman responds, her expression less friendly. 
Given your reluctance, she grins maliciously.


<font:speech> "Oh, I know your kind! A knight in the shining armor. Thinking of yourself being better than others.
Waiting for a true love, aren't you?" <font:narration>


She lights a cigarette.


<font:speech> "How old are you, boy? Eighteen? Nineteen? Still a virgin, I bet! 
Dreaming of Her, the perfect woman, right?" <font:narration> 


You realize she is drunk. Her eyes are dull and unfocused, her accent sharp.


<font:speech> "Ha! Keep waiting, boy! But you know what? The world doesn't give a damn about you! 
It is a crappy place! Cold and merciless! Nothing will fall into your lap unless you reach for it! 
That's life, boy! Stop dreaming! Wake up!" <font:narration>


...



<font:speech> "Wake up!" <font:narration>


The last remark is not part of the vision. It is Alisa who is urging you to come back.


But the voice is the same. It is the voice of the lady from your graduation party. 


You stare at your wrist.


It is impossible! What is going on here?


<font:speech> "Finally!" <font:narration> Alisa says as you stand up. 
<font:speech> "I was worried you'd never come back." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Who are you, Alisa?" <font:narration> you ask quietly.


She muses then says: <font:speech> "I am your assistant, Karl. I am here to help you." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Why do you speak with her voice?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Because I am her," <font:narration> Alisa answers.


You open your mouth to ask what she means but then the device goes off.
You know won't get any more answers from her now.
