Memory of the graduation evening
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another memory rises in the darkness and suddenly everything clicks into place. You know it now! Alisa's voice! You remember where you heard it.


...



The day of the graduation. You finished the Academy as one of the best. It was not easy but you gave yourself a push. You had someone to look up to, after all.


The club is crowded. Half-naked, sweaty bodies throw chaotic shadows on the dance floor. The music is ear-battering and the air is sticky. Mick and the others are drunk already. They are not around. You stand up and push yourself through the crowd towards the backyard exit. 


Fresh air fills your lungs as you step outside. The night sky is moonless. Stars shuffle with city lights above you. It is silent barring the dull music beat from within the club. The back-alley is empty.


Then you see three shadows in a corner. A woman. Around thirty. She is pretty and dazzling but her attractive face wears a frown. Two men are leaning towards her. Probably drunk. They are talking to her, loud and agitated. The woman seems to be in trouble.


One of the men pushes the woman against the wall and grabs her arm.


<font:speech> "Leave me alone, you moron!" <font:narration> she shouts with an evident accent. 


The drunkard does not let go. He strikes out his arm...


You stride in the direction of the three and push the man by the shoulder. 


His partner roars and attacks you. 


You are not the best fighter but both your opponents are drunk and much older than you. The fight is over soon and they retreat, tossing curses at you and the woman.


<font:speech> "Are you alright?" <font:narration> you ask her. 


The woman looks you up and down, then smiles. Her stressful expression dissipates in an instant. 


<font:speech> "Thanks, dear! You are my hero. These two were a real pain." <font:narration> Suddenly, she comes closer to you and lays her hand on your shoulder. 


<font:speech> "You deserve a reward, handsome." <font:narration>


You flinch with sudden embarrassment, muttering something. The woman laughs and reaches for your hand.


<font:speech> "Come on, darling. Relax. Let's have some fun." <font:narration>


Her breath smells of alcohol. As you withdraw she frowns. 


<font:speech> "What's wrong with you. Oh, you're one of..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No," <font:narration> you say. <font:speech> "No, I'm not. It's just... I don't even know you." <font:narration> 


<font:speech> "Don't worry, I work here," <font:narration> the woman responds, her expression less friendly. Given your reluctance, she grins wryly.


<font:speech> "Oh, I know your kind. A knight in the shining armor. Thinking of yourself being better than others. Waiting for a true love, aren't we?" <font:narration>


She pushes you away and crosses her arms. 


<font:speech> "How old are you? Eighteen? Nineteen? Still a virgin, I bet! Dreaming of Her, the perfect woman." <font:narration> 


You realize that she is drunk. Her eyes are dull and unfocused, her accent sharp. 


<font:speech> "Ha! You will learn soon enough, boy! The world doesn't give a damn about you! It is a crappy place! Nothing will fall into your lap unless you reach for it! That's life, boy! Stop dreaming! Wake up!" <font:narration>


...



<font:speech> "Wake up!" <font:narration>


The last remark is not part of the vision. It is Alisa who is urging you to come back.


But the voice is the same. It is the voice of the lady from your graduation party. 


You shake off the rests of the hallucination and stare at your wrist. 


It is impossible. What is going on here?


<font:speech> "Finally!" <font:narration> Alisa says as you stand up. <font:speech> "I was worrying." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Who are you, Alisa?" <font:narration> you ask quietly.


<font:speech> "Let a woman keep her little secrets," <font:narration> she responds firmly. 


You have a feeling that you will not get out more of her. 


Not now, at least.


You can't stop thinking about Alisa's person as you continue your journey in silence.
