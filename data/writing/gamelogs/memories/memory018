The battery
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vision does not take long and does not bear any fruits. 
You find yourself in front of the monolith without having any chance to join Mary.


<font:speech> "Kicked out again?" <font:narration> 


Alisa's voice has a note of melancholy to it. 


You nod, wondering at her mood. <font:speech> "It is as if she does not let me through." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "What will you do?" <font:narration> 


Alisa's strangely placid tone is bothering you but you do not ask her for the cause, focused on your own problem. 
There is an unusual sentiment rummaging in you since your last vision. 


You feel defiance.


<font:speech> "You know, whether I join her or not is my decision alone. 
Mary might not like it but I will do it 
even if I have to scrub off the dust from the surface of every monolith in the valley. 
She cannot stop me." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Wow," <font:narration> Alisa replies. 
<font:speech> "You are starting to learn. Finally, my assistance pays off." 
<font:narration> She does not seem happy, though. 
<font:speech> "Although, as may be the case, you have to go without it in the future." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "What are you talking about?" <font:narration> 


You look at the assistant device and see a small yellow indicator blinking on its side.


<font:speech> "The battery," <font:narration> Alisa says. <font:speech> "It is almost depleted."
