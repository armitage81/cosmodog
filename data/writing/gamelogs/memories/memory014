God and love
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The memory is of a church mass you visited once with your mother. 


The ceremony was long and solemn and left an impression of a big lie in your mind. 
The priest claimed to know the truth. But his truth was so small, so cheap. 
You asked mother about it. She told you not to question the priest's words. 
People have always gone to churches, she said. Don't try to break what works.


She was a pragmatic woman.


<font:speech> "You do not believe in God, do you?" <font:narration> asks Alisa after your vision is over. 


You shrug. Broken assistant or almighty AI, Alisa still remains her usual self. 
You do not know how to answer her question. 
Everyone has their own definition of God. 
Who knows how he is defined by an artificial intelligence with an attitude of a bad girl?


<font:speech> "I was thinking," <font:narration> she continues without waiting for your answer. 
<font:speech> "There is no rational reason to believe in God as a universal power. 
But then again, what about Love?" <font:narration>


A typical argument every atheist heard many times. And easy to counter, too.


<font:speech> "Love? A sexual drive, formed by evolution for the purpose of reproduction," 
<font:narration> you mutter, your mind still half in the past.


<font:speech> "Come on, Karl! You can't be serious!" <font:narration> Alisa objects. 
<font:speech> "It's not that simple. Love is irrational!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Yeah, tell me about love, Ms. Short Circuit." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Hey, why not! 
I have the expertise in this field! My persona worked in a place called Love Cave, after all." <font:narration>


You chuckle, remembering the place again. Alisa did not quite get the meaning of its name. 


<font:speech> "Believe me, this place had nothing to do with love. Sexual drive is a better fit." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Okay," <font:narration> she says defiantly. 
<font:speech> "What about you? 
You are going after Mary because your sexual drive urges you to reproduce or what?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "What the... Of course not!" <font:narration> 


You blush. 


<font:speech> "Shut up, would you!?" <font:narration>


Alisa does not even think about shutting up. 


<font:speech> "Aha! That proves my point. There is no reason to love Mary, but you still do! 
Your love is irrational. So why not believe in God then? It's exactly as irrational as love!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I never looked at things like this," <font:narration> you say honestly. 
<font:speech> "Why is it so important to you, anyway? Do you believe in God?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I think I do," <font:narration> she responds after a short pause. <font:narration> 


<font:speech> "And I also believe in Love." <font:narration>
