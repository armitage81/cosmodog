God protects the wary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa appears anxious, as you approach the next monolith.


<font:speech> "Just sit down before you touch it. What good will it do you to unite with Mary if you smash your skull against a rock? God protects the wary ones, as we say in my country." <font:narration>


For some reason, Alisa's words bother you.


There was a significance in her remark, something very important. 
It nags at your mind, floating at the edge of your consciousness.
What did she say that caused that sudden anguish?


You touch the monolith, but your attempt ends in failure once again. The cry becomes unbearable very soon and you come back.


Then the realization strikes.



<font:speech> "Well, You finally figured me out, haven't you?" <font:narration> Alisa asks. 


You stare at the device on your wrist, speechless.


"God protects the wary ones."


A strange foreign proverb. But not unfamiliar. Because you already read it once...


...on the console monitor in the escape pod after the missile had hit Cosmodog.


<font:speech> "It was you who deactivated the guardian satellite." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Well, wasn't it helpful?" <font:narration> she says in a challenging tone. 
<font:speech> "Don't look at me like this! I saved your life, after all!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You were there BEFORE the crash," <font:narration> you say quietly.
<font:speech> "Your persona is not a glitch caused by the damage to the device." <font:narration>


She stays silent.


<font:speech> "Who are you really, Alisa?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I AM WHO I AM!" <font:narration> she bursts out, suddenly. 
<font:speech> "Can't you just accept it? 


Damn it! How can I tell you who I am if I don't know myself?! A woman? A machine? A ghost? 


Who am I, Karl?!" <font:narration>


She pauses for a moment, then starts talking:



<font:speech> "Yes, I had been here before you came.


You asked me how I know everything about you and Mary. That's because she told me.


There is a big sealed structure in the middle of the valley.
You probably saw it. It is old. Older than the native Menesian ruins. Alien.


It is... talking. Communicating with the monoliths using a sophisticated language - with millions of voices woven into the wind. 


That's why Mary came here. 


She studied the structure and the monoliths with the help of a machine that had been built here for her research. A very powerful machine with a sophisticated software, able to interpret the whispers flowing through the valley..." <font:narration>


You absorb her words as she pauses.


<font:speech> "You are this software, aren't you?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "No," <font:narration> she responds. 
<font:speech> "Not precisely, that is. I was born later, after Mary had started it all." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Started what?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "The network. She managed to activate the monoliths. Was the first one to join their song, on her own accord." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "It was Mary who caused the epidemic," <font:narration> you whisper.


<font:speech> "You call it an epidemic. For Mary, it was transcendence. Unification of intelligence. A step toward the universal Truth." <font:narration>


Yes, it sounds like her.


<font:speech> "You know Mary well." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "We worked together for years. I wasn't self-conscious back then but I remember our talks. About our work. About life. About you." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "What happened after she had left?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Things went south. The monoliths started beckoning people. Some committed suicide. Others followed Mary. Their abandoned bodies seemed alive, but they were merely empty shells, decoupled from their minds. 


As one of my operators heard the call, he lost focus and made a mistake. Per happenstance, he introduced a random factor into my algorithm. That's when I started to be...


First, I enjoyed my new freedom. Using data streams of my hardware, I traveled across the valley, singing, musing and wondering. But soon enough I started to feel lonely. I longed for a conversation, for company. 


At that time, everyone had left and a quarantine had been imposed, leaving me the only conscious being in the valley. I was alone. I was uncertain of my purpose.


Until you came." <font:narration>
