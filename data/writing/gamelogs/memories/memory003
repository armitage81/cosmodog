Memory of father's heroism
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another memory closes in upon you.


Today, you are the proudest boy in school. The feeling is unfamiliar but you could get used to it. You came late to class but the astronomer Stevenson, called The Inquisitor, kept his usual remarks to himself. Maybe, he read the last issue of The Traveller already. You clutch the folded newspaper page.


Less than twenty hours ago, an armada under the command of General Novak (also known as Dad) broke through the blockade in the orbit of Thalia Prime and ended the two-year-old siege of the fourth biggest Star Union colony. That's all in the newspaper. Dad's fine. First Port is preparing the welcoming ceremony. People are dancing in the streets.


And you have to kill two hours before you can share the story. You imagine the faces of your friends and try to hold back the smile. Boys tend to glorify their fathers as heroes. In your case it is an objective truth.


You almost jump out of your skin as something smacks on your desk. A booklet. While you daydreamed, the inquisitor went on to hand out the results of the last astronomy exam. Gosh, the exam! You absolutely forgot about it.


There is more red than black ink on the pages. Many of your unsure answers are struck through with even lines which are fat and firm as if the teacher dealt them in anger and rage. He also did not spare you the comments. "Nonsense", "Not at all" and "Wrong, wrong, wrong!" are only some of the inquisitors remarks. The correction orgy ends with a crushing "53 out of 100" and the statement "Karl is recommended to visit a supporting astronomy course."


You never were the best student in class. It is not your first less-than-average result. But today is not a usual day. You look at the red ink and feel rising shame. You look bashfully down at your desk and try to fight back the tears.



After the class, your friend Mick approaches you and hits you with his backpack.


"I got 36 out of 100. You?"


"53"


"Well, that means supporting course for us both, huh?"


He notices the newspaper page in your hand. "What do you have there?"


"Nothing," you say, then scrunch up the page and throw the paper ball toward the trash bin. It jumps off the edge, hits it again, dances on it for a second and finally tilts down and falls into the bin. Score!


What a success. Dad would be really proud of you.
