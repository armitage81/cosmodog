Memory of the mental hospital
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The memory is fresh. It happened just before you traveled to Phaeton.



<font:memory> You see yourself in a clean room of a mental hospital.


The room is lit. White tiles. Flowers in vases. The nurses attend to their business. Talk quietly. Pretend not to listen.


Mary sits in a wheelchair, looking at you. Through you. No recognition in her eyes.
She wears a cyan overall. Slippers. In her hands - a toy dog in a red space suit. 


Cosmodog.


You brought it with you, hoping it would trigger something. A memory. A sign of awareness.
But she just sits there, unreachable as she always was, just in a different way.



<font:narration> Mary was found on Lydia, the northern continent of Phaeton.
Unconscious. Dehydrated. Demented. On request of the AIV rector, the Fleet organized her evacuation. 
She was brought to Vera. The rector notified you. You came with the next possible jump window.


You talked to Mary for a week straight. Nothing helped. She just sat there. Mindless. Absent.


The helplessness drove you crazy. 
You started reading through her notes. Spoke with her colleagues. Researched news from Phaeton. 
Your investigation led you to a surprising conclusion. 


Mary's case had not been unique. The Star Union considered Phaeton an off-limit planet and had put it under 
quarantine due to its influence on human minds.



It is your seventh night in the hospital when you have a dream.


A sunset on an alien world...


A big red structure standing out across the horizon, throwing its long shadow over the plain field... You wake up with an idea. 


Mary is still there, on Phaeton. Whatever form her identity might take now, you will go there, find her, and reunite with her.


Cosmodog is ready for the flight.
