Memory of receiving Cosmodog
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:speech> "You should take a break, Karl,"
<font:narration> Alisa says anxiously as you approach the next monolith.
<font:speech> "Those things are bad. Last time I thought I'd lost you." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I'm fine," <font:narration> you say. 


<font:speech> "Okay, okay, no need to listen to me!" <font:narration> Alisa drawls sarcastically.
<font:speech> "I'm just your PERSONAL ADVISER, all right! Go on, ruin yourself, I don't care!" 


<font:narration> Her voice softens. 


<font:speech> "Just take care, okay?" <font:narration>


...



The memory is a roller coaster of emotions.
You are in the hotel room on Athena, waiting for the conference to finish.
You feel broken and empty, useless nuisance in between the flights. Time just does not want to pass.


It has been four days since you had last met Mary. And what a meeting it was!


Somehow, you managed to ask her for a date. 


You had no idea what drove into you and you regretted your improvised suggestion immediately after you had spoken it out. 
What did you do, man!? A country fair? That's your offer to her, farmer boy? 
Sure, exactly the thing a woman like her would like. Idiot!


You could not believe your ears as Mary accepted the invitation.


That evening was fantastic. You talked about random things. Mary smiled at your funny stories. 
She won at the clay target shooting and you showed off your piloting skills at the arcade. 
You argued about the name of the space dog from the cartoon of your childhood. 
You are quite sure you won the latter argument. As she took leave, Mary gave you a hug and wished you good night. 


You did not hear of her since.


...



You are desperate and clueless. Why did she not send a message, at least? Then again, why didn't you? 


For the tenth time you grab the communicator and immediately put it back again. 
You do not dare to call. She is a busy woman, speaking at a scientific conference. 
She does not have time for idle chitchat. 


Anyway, what would you tell her? 


You pace up and down, restless, not daring to leave the hotel room and risking to miss a call. 
She already forgot everything, you say to yourself. She has to think about more important things.


There is a knock on the door. You stop dead in your tracks, then go and open the door. 
A cheerful courier stands there.


<font:speech> "I've got a package for your kid," 
<font:narration> she says and passes you a toy dog 
wearing a red space suit and a transparent bubble helmet with a small note attached to it. 


The courier laughs.
<font:speech> "I know this one. It's the dog from the old cartoon. I loved it as a child. What was its title again?"
<font:narration>


You run over the note and a wave of happiness engulfs you. 


She did not forget, after all. And she was right about the name. Of course she was.


You smile happily. 


<font:speech> "Cosmodog," <font:narration> you say to the courier.
<font:speech> "The cartoon's title was Cosmodog. I love it, too!" <font:narration>
