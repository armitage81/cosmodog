Memory of receiving Cosmodog
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:speech> "You should take a break, Karl,"
<font:narration> Alisa says anxiously as you approach the next monolith.
<font:speech> "Those things are bad. Do you know what they did to all the people here?" <font:narration>


You know, of course. The planet is off-limits for a reason: mass dementia.
The epidemic wiped out the entire colony, leaving its inhabitants gathered around the monoliths — alive, but not truly living.


Among them: Mary.


<font:speech> "I'm fine," <font:narration> you say. 


<font:speech> "Okay, okay, no need to listen to me!" <font:narration> Alisa drawls sarcastically.
<font:speech> "I'm just your PERSONAL ADVISER, all right! Go on, ruin yourself, I don't care!" 


<font:narration> Her voice softens. 


<font:speech> "Just take care, okay?" <font:narration>


...



The memory is a roller coaster of emotions.
You are in the hotel room on Athena, waiting for the conference to finish.
You feel broken and empty.


It has been four days since you had last met Mary. And what a meeting it was!


You went to an old-fashioned fair, chatting about random things as you wandered through the stalls.
Mary smiled at your funny stories.
She won at the clay target shooting and you showed off your piloting skills at the arcade. 
You argued about the name of the character from the cartoon of your childhood.
You are quite sure you won the latter argument. It was Space Dog.
As she took leave, Mary gave you a hug and wished you good night. 


You did not hear of her since.


...



For the tenth time you grab the communicator and immediately put it back again. 
You do not dare to call. Mary is a busy woman, speaking at a scientific conference. 
She does not have time for idle chitchat. 


Anyway, what would you tell her? 


You pace up and down, restless, not daring to leave the hotel room for fear of missing a call.
She already forgot everything, you say to yourself. She has to think about more important things.


There is a knock at the door. You freeze for a moment before opening the door.
A cheerful courier stands there.


<font:speech> "I've got a package for your kid," 
<font:narration> she says and passes you a toy dog 
wearing a red space suit and a transparent bubble helmet with a small note attached to it. 


The courier laughs.
<font:speech> "I know this one. It's the dog from this old cartoon. 
I loved it as a child. How was it called again?"
<font:narration>


You scan the note, and a wave of happiness washes over you.


Mary hasn’t forgotten you, after all.


<font:speech> "Cosmodog," <font:narration> you say, pointing at the note, wide smile on your face.
<font:speech> "It was called Cosmodog. I love it, too!" <font:narration>
