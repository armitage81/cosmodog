Xenoarchaeology class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red monolith looms over you. A sudden breeze wafts across your face. You hear voices in the distance, whispers, words beyond recognition. There are millions of them. You don't understand them but feel the gravity of their meaning. The world around you vanishes, replaced by darkness sprinkled with distant lights. 


Stars. 


Howling of wind. 


Without seeing it, you touch the monolith's surface. A vague memory enwraps you. Not a good one. It hurts, but you give in and face it...


...



You are in a class. A comfortable room with old-fashioned 
wooden desks and wide windows. Outside, snow is falling down on the distant ground, shrouding the neighboring towers of the university. You are here to see her. The teacher.


You made acquaintance with Ms. Harper two weeks ago. Her team chartered your ship. It was a flight to an excavation site on BZ-17. Since then, you could not stop thinking about her. 


Actually, Mary is above your league. She is smart and beautiful, a professor at thirty. Very likely surrounded by fans and admirers. She barely noticed you during the expedition. And yet you are here.


You look at Mary. Elegant, delicate, with long black hair falling down to her left shoulder. Smartness in her bright eyes. She is slightly taller than you...  


<font:speech> "Why are you smiling, Mr. Novak," <font:narration> she asks suddenly, frowning. You turn pale...


...



Then you hear it. A silent female cry. It is not part of your memory. In contrary, it breaks the illusion. Something is wrong. You cling to the vision, but the cry distracts you. Finally, you cannot keep it up and let it go.


The memory fades. The world appears around you. You find yourself standing in front of the monolith.
 


<font:speech> "Karl! Karl? Are you alright?" <font:narration>


Did Alisa feel it, too? Did she see what you saw? You certainly hope not.


<font:speech> "I'm ok," <font:narration> you respond. <font:speech> "We must go on." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "For a while I thought you'd fainted." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Nothing to worry about." <font:narration>


That is it! You are on the right path. Mary is here. You can feel her presence. The next time you will not fail.


<font:speech> "I need to find more of those towers." <font:narration>


Alisa does not seem surprised. <font:speech> "As you wish, dear. I'm sticking with you." <font:narration>


As you turn and walk away from the red structure, she manages to stay quiet for a whole minute. Then she cannot hold it anymore and breaks the silence.


<font:speech> "This professor lady must mean a lot to you." <font:narration>
