Xenoarchaeology class

You recognize the monolith the moment you see it. One of the famous red pillars scattered around the Lydport colony. Ancient. Mysterious. Inspiring.


Beckoning...


A sudden breeze wafts across your face.
You hear voices in the distance - whispers and words beyond recognition.
The world around you vanishes, replaced by darkness sprinkled with distant lights.


Stars. 


Howling of wind.


You touch the slick red surface...



<font:memory> You are in a class room.


Old-fashioned wooden desks. Wide windows.
Outside, snow is falling on the distant ground, shrouding the neighboring towers of the university.
The lecture is open for public, but you are not interested in gaining knowledge today. 


You are here to see Ms. Harper.


Mary.


She is, in fact, out of your league.
A smart and beautiful woman, professor at thirty, surrounded by fans and admirers. 
What could a simple freighter pilot possibly offer to a woman like her?


And yet you are here.


You look at Mary. Elegant, delicate, long black hair falling down to her left shoulder. Smartness in her bright eyes.


<font:speech> "Why are you smiling, Mr. Novak," <font:memory> she asks suddenly. You are startled...



<font:narration> Then you hear it. A silent cry. It is not part of your memory.
On the contrary, it breaks the illusion. Something is wrong.
You cling to the vision, but the cry distracts you until you let it go.


The memory fades. The world appears around you. You find yourself standing in front of the monolith.



<font:speech> "Karl! Karl? Are you still with me?" <font:narration>


Alisa. Did she see what you saw? You certainly hope not.


<font:speech> "I'm ok." <font:narration> 


Your palm remains on the monolith, but its magic has faded, leaving behind cold and lifeless stone.
Whatever the power of the monolith came from, now it is just a simple red pillar jutting out of the landscape.


There are still others, however.


<font:speech> "For a while I thought you'd be gone." <font:narration>


Alisa seems genuinely concerned for you, but you ignore her.
You are on the right path. Next time you won't fail.


<font:speech> "I must find another one." <font:narration>


She does not appear surprised. <font:speech> "Got it, dear. I'm sticking with you." <font:narration>


As you turn and walk away from the monolith, Alisa manages to stay quiet for a whole minute. Then she breaks the silence.


<font:speech> "This professor lady must mean a lot to you." <font:narration>
