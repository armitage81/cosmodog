Xenoarchaeology class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The red monolith looms over you. A sudden breeze wafts across your face. You hear voices in the distance, whispers, words beyond recognition. There are millions of them. The world around you vanishes, replaced by darkness sprinkled with distant lights. 


Stars. 


Howling of wind. 


Without seeing it, you touch the monolith's surface...


...



You are in a class. 
A comfortable room with old-fashioned wooden desks and wide windows. 
Outside, snow is falling down on the distant ground, shrouding the neighboring towers of the university.
The lecture is open for public, but you are not here to learn. 


You are here to see the Ms Harper.


Your first meet was two weeks ago when her team chartered your freighter for an archeological expedition. 
You could not get her out of your head since then. 


Actually, Mary is above your league. 
A smart and beautiful woman, professor at thirty, surrounded by fans and admirers. 
What could a simple freighter pilot offer her?


And yet you are here.


You look at Mary. Elegant, delicate, with long black hair falling down to her left shoulder. Smartness in her bright eyes.


<font:speech> "Why are you smiling, Mr. Novak," <font:narration> she asks suddenly. You startle...


...



Then you hear it. A silent cry. It is not part of your memory. 
In contrary, it breaks the illusion. Something is wrong. 
You cling to the vision, but the cry distracts you until you cannot keep it up and let it go.


The memory fades. The world appears around you. You find yourself standing in front of the monolith.



<font:speech> "Karl! Karl? Are you alright?" <font:narration>


Did Alisa see see what you saw? 


You certainly hope not.


<font:speech> "I'm ok." <font:narration> 


Your palm is still touching the monolith but its power has gone. 
Now it is just a simple red pillar jutting out of the landscape.
But there are others. 


<font:speech> "For a while I thought you'd fainted." <font:narration>


Alisa seems genuinly concerned for you but you ignore her. You are on the right path. Mary is here somewhere. The next time you will not fail.


<font:speech> "I need to find more of those towers." <font:narration>


Alisa does not seem surprised. <font:speech> "As you wish, dear. I'm sticking with you." <font:narration>


As you turn and walk away from the monolith, she manages to stay quiet for a whole minute. Then she breaks the silence.


<font:speech> "This professor lady must mean a lot to you." <font:narration>
