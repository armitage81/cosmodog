Xenoarchaeology class

Karl Novak - 001: In the archaeology class


The red monolith looms over you. A sudden breeze wafts across your face. You hear voices in the distance, whispers, words beyond recognition. There are millions of them. You don't know them but feel the gravity of their meaning. The world around you vanishes, replaced by darkness sprinkled with distant lights. Stars. Howling of wind. 


Without seeing it, you touch the monolith's surface. A vague memory is brought to your mind, old and suppressed but real. It hurts, but you give in and face it...


You are in a xenoarchaeology class. A comfortable room with old-fashioned 
wooden desks and wide windows. Outside, snow is falling down on the distant ground, shrouding the neighboring towers of the university. You pretended to participate in an advanced training for your job as a pilot, but the truth is you wanted to meet her again. Mary Harper. The teacher.


You made acquaintance with Ms. Harper as her team chartered your ship for a flight to an excavation site on BZ-17, two weeks ago. Since then, you could not stop thinking about her. 


Not that you had a chance. Mary is out of your league. Smart and beautiful. A professor at thirty. Probably surrounded by fans and admirers. She barely noticed you during the expedition. Yet you could not help but enlist for the class to see her again.


The lesson is an abstract introduction in the history of archaeology. Sophisticated and boring. You don't focus on listening, anyway. You look at Mary. Elegant, delicate, with long black hair falling down to her left shoulder, smartness in her brown eyes. Slightly taller than you. She resembles the heroine from the "Goddess of Space" cartoon.  


"Why are you smiling, Mr. Novak," she asks suddenly, frowning. You turn pale...


And then you hear it. A silent female cry. You don't know where it comes from. It is not part of your memory. In contrary, it breaks the illusion. Something is wrong. You cling to the memory, but the cry distracts you until you're out of mental strength and let it go.


The memory fades. The world appears again around you. You find yourself standing in front of the monolith.



You hear Alisa calling you. "Karl! Karl? Are you alright?"


Did Alisa feel it, too? Did she see what you saw? You certainly hope not.


"I'm ok," you respond. "We must go on."


"For a while I thought you'd fainted."


"Nothing to worry about," you say evasively.


You don't want to tell her about Mary. You are on the right path. She was here. She interacted with the monolith in the same way you did. The next time you will not fail.


"I need to find more of those towers."


Alisa does not seem surprised. "As you wish, dear. I'm sticking with you."


As you turn and walk away from the red structure, she manages to stay quiet for ninety-five seconds. Then she breaks the silence.


"This professor lady must have meant a lot to you."
