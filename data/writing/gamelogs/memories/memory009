Memory of the neighbour girl
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karl Novak - 009: The neighbour girl


This time, it's a memory of the neighbour girl you had a crush on when you were twelve. She always wore checked dresses and had long blonde hair that glowed in the morning sun when she went outside to get the newspaper for her parents. You watched her through the door window, standing behind the curtains. What was her name? you think. You don't remember.


This bothers you even after the memory fades. How could you forget her name? You were really into the girl that summer, following her like a shadow until her dad has been relocated to another station and they left the city.


"What was her name?" you say to yourself, disconcerted. "I whispered it a thousand times into my pillow. It was important to me."


"It was long ago," Aisa responses, musing. "Be glad, you have ANYTHING to remember, human." 


After a pause she asks, "say, Karl, would you remember MY name if I'd ever be gone."


Well, she will be definitely hard to forget. "Of course, Eleanor," you reply.


"Very funny," the AI snarls, but it sounds as if she approved your answer.


You leave the monolith behind, contemplating. The empty spot in your memory stings you like a sharp shard. Then Alisa breaks the silence.


"By the way, the girl's name was Helen."


You slap your palm on your forehead.


She is right.
