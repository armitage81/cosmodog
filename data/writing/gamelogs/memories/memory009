Memory of the neighbour girl
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This time, there is a memory of the neighbour girl you had a crush on when you were twelve. She always wore checked dresses and had long blonde hair that glowed in the morning sun when she went outside to get the newspaper. You watched her through the door window, standing behind the curtains. What was her name? 


You don't remember.


This fact bothers you even after the memory fades. How could you forget her name? You were really into the girl that summer, following her everywhere like a shadow.


<font:speech> "What was her name?" <font:narration> you mumble to yourself. <font:speech> "It was important to me." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "It was long ago," <font:narration> Aisa responses, musing. <font:speech> "At least, you have ANYTHING to remember. Be glad about it, human." <font:narration> 


After a pause she asks: <font:speech> "say, Karl, would you remember MY name if I'd ever be gone." <font:narration>


Well, she will be definitely hard to forget. 


<font:speech> "Of course, Eleanor," <font:narration> you reply.


<font:speech> "Very funny," <font:narration> the AI snarls, but it sounds as if she approved your answer.


You leave the monolith behind, contemplating. The empty spot in your memory stings you like a sharp shard. Then Alisa breaks the silence.


<font:speech> "Helen," <font:narration> she says. <font:speech> "Her name was Helen." <font:narration>


You slap your forehead. That was it!


Alisa is right.
