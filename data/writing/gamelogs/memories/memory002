Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind rises in the star-sprinkled darkness and whispers surround you again as you touch the monolith.


Another vision. 


It is the day you first met Mary...


...



The Archaeological Institute of Vera chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site. 
A long and eventless journey.


You are doing the usual routine inspection as you see Mary sitting in the hold, looking at stars through the porthole.


Some spontaneous impulse lets you stop and accost her.


<font:speech> "So, a xenoarchaeological expedition," <font:narration> you say dully.


She nods without turning from the view outside. Her mind seems to voyage between the stars.


You shrug, feinting indifference.


<font:speech> "I never got archaeology. 
Why spend so much effort and time just to reveal things that are long gone?" <font:narration>


Now you have her attention... and immediately regretting it.
Caught in Mary's glance, you feel like an insect under a microscope. 


<font:speech> "Archaeology is not only about things that are gone, Mr. Novak," <font:narration> she says calmly. 
<font:speech> "Knowing how civilizations evolved in the past can help us to model their further evolution. 
Here you have it. Archaeology is also about predicting the future." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Isn't Astrology enough to do the trick?" <font:narration> you ask,
feeling a sudden urge to say something funny and clever.


Mary smiles at the joke and your heart jumps.


Then you hear cry again. The vision fades. Mary's face blurs and you wake up.


...



<font:speech> "So cuuute, both of you." <font:narration>


Alisas tone is half mocking, half sincere.


<font:speech> "Let me alone," <font:narration> you snarl. <font:speech> 
"Anyway, how do you know what I saw? Did I talk when it happened?" <font:narration>


There is a moment of silence. Very unusual for Alisa.


<font:speech> "No, I just felt it, the same way you did," <font:narration> she says finally. 


<font:speech> "Seriously? How come? Those memories are mine. The monoliths trigger them. I hallucinate. 
It is all in my head. You cannot 'feel' what is in my head!" <font:narration>


Alisa's answer sounds a bit irritated:


<font:speech> "Don't ask me, okay?! I really don't know how it works." <font:narration>


You look at the broken assistant device and frown. This glitch goes way too far.


Why does her voice sound so familiar!?
