Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind starts howling around you with the same sudden vehemency and the whispers approach you again from all sides in the star-sprinkled darkness. You listen intently, eager to remember.


The memory is about the day you first met Mary. Archaeological Institute of Vera chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site. The flight was long and eventless. You remember her sitting in front of the porthole, looking at the stars outside. Your first casual talk. A short discussion about the purpose of xenoarchaeology. You wonder why this science puts so much effort focusing on the past and Mary argues that archaeology is not about the past but about predicting the future. Feeling a sudden urge to impress her with your cleverness, you mention that with astrology there is already such a science. Mary smiles at the joke and your heart makes a jump.


You don't want to leave, but there is this cry again. You try not to focus on it but is is a steady sound in your mind. It destroys the vision. You wake up.



"So romantic," sounds Alisa's voice from your wrist when the vision is over. "Give me a handkerchief, honey."


"Very funny", you snarl. "Does it mean, you have access to those visions?"


"I just sense them, like you do," she says evasively. Something is shady about her answer. You don't buy it.


"But those memories are mine. The monoliths provoke them. I hallucinate. You can't "sense" hallucinations. You're a machine."


Alisa laughs a weird laugh. "Don't judge others based on their appearance, Karl. Sometimes, there is much more to a person than seems at first."


You halt and inspect the broken assistant device. This glitch goes way too far.


And why does the voice sound so familiar!? 


You keep contemplating about it as you walk away from the monolith.
