Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind rises in the star-sprinkled darkness, and whispers surround you again.


Another vision.


It is the day you first met Mary. The Archaeological Institute of Vera chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site. 
A long and eventless journey. 
Mary is sitting in the hold, looking at stars through the porthole. She seems bored.


<font:speech> "So, an xenoarcheological expedition," <font:narration> you say dully. 
She nods, barely noticing you. 
But you don't give up. 
<font:speech> "Is it actually worth it to spent so much effort for things that are long gone?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Archaeology is not only about the past," <font:narration> Mary says calmly. 
<font:speech> "It is also about predicting the future." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Isn't Astrology enough to do the trick?" <font:narration> you ask, feeling a sudden urge to say something funny and clever.


Mary smiles at the joke and your heart jumps.


...



There is this cry again. You try to ignore it but it keeps distracting you, a steady sound in your mind. 


The vision fades. Mary's face blurs and you wake up.


...



Alisa drawls the words deliberately: <font:speech> "So cute, both of you." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Very funny," <font:narration> you snarl. <font:speech> "Anyway, how do you know what the vision was about?" <font:narration>


There is a silent pause. Very unusual for Alisa.


<font:speech> "I just felt it, like you did," <font:narration> she says finally. 


You do not buy it.


<font:speech> "How come? Those memories are mine. The monoliths trigger them. I hallucinate. It is in my head. You cannot 'feel' what is in my head!" <font:narration>


Alisa's answer sounds a bit irritated:


<font:speech> "Don't ask me! I really don't know how it works." <font:narration>


You check the device on your wrist.


<font:speech> "By the way, I have a news for you. You cannot 'feel' anything. You are a machine." <font:narration>


She laughs awkwardly. 


<font:speech> "Do not judge others based on their appearance, dear. Sometimes, there is much more to a person than it seems at first." <font:narration>


You look at the broken assistant device and frown. This glitch goes way too far.


Why does her voice sound so familiar!?


You keep thinking about it as you walk away from the monolith.
