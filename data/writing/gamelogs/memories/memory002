Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind rises in the star-sprinkled darkness and whispers surround you again as you touch the monolith.


Another vision. 


It is the day you first met Mary...



<font:memory> The Archaeological Institute of Vera chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site.
The journey is long and uneventful.


Walking by, you see Mary sitting in the hold, looking at the stars through the porthole.


An impulse makes you stop and approach her.


<font:speech> "So, a xenoarchaeological expedition," <font:memory> you say dully.


She nods without turning from the view outside. Her mind seems to drift among the stars, lost in their endless expanse.


You shrug, feigning indifference.


<font:speech> "I never got archaeology. 
You guys spend so much effort and time just to reveal things that are long gone. Is it even worth it?" <font:memory>


Now you have her attention... and immediately regretting it.
Caught in Mary's gaze, you feel exposed, as though under a microscope.


<font:speech> "Archaeology is not only about things that are gone, Mr. Novak," <font:memory> she says calmly.
<font:speech> "You see, all civilizations evolve following a pattern.
Understanding this pattern can help us predict our own development.
Here you have it. Archaeology is not only about the past. It is also about predicting the future." <font:memory>


<font:speech> "Doesn't astrology do the trick?" <font:memory> you ask,
feeling a sudden urge to say something clever.


Mary smiles at the joke and your heart jumps.



<font:narration> You hear the cry once more. Piercing. Disconcerting. Dismissive.
You reach for Mary, but the vision dissolves, her face fading into a blur as you wake up.


<font:speech> "First date in a space ship. So cute, both of you." <font:narration>


Alisa's tone carries a mix of mockery and sincerity.
You frown.


<font:speech> "How do you know what I saw?" <font:narration>


There is a moment of silence. Very unusual for Alisa.


<font:speech> "Let's say, you are easy to read, dear," <font:narration> she says finally. 


You look at the broken assistant device and sigh. This glitch goes way too far.


Why does her voice feel so familiar?
