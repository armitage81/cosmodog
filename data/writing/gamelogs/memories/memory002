Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karl Novak - 002: Talking with mary in the ship


The wind starts howling around you with the same sudden vehemency and the whispers surround you again in the star-sprinkled darkness. You listen intently, eager to perceive every detail.


It's the day you first met Mary. Archaeological Institute of Vera chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site. The flight was long and eventless. You remember her sitting in front of the porthole, looking at the stars outside. Your first casual talk. A short discussion about the purpose of xenoarchaeology. You wonder why this science puts so much effort focusing on the past and Mary argues that archaeology is not about the past but about predicting the future. Feeling a sudden urge to impress her with your cleverness, you mention that with astrology there is already such a science. Mary smiles at the joke and your heart makes a jump.


There is this cry again. You try not to focus on it but is is a steady sound in your mind. It destroys the vision. Mary's face blurs and you wake up.



"So romantic," Alisa's voice sounds from your wrist. "Give me a handkerchief, honey."


"Very funny", you snarl. "How do you know what it was about?"


"I just sense it, like you do," she says evasively. Something is shady about her answer. You don't buy it.


"But those memories are mine. The monoliths provoke them. I hallucinate. You can't "sense" hallucinations. You're a machine."


Alisa laughs a weird laugh. "Don't judge others based on their appearance, Karl. Sometimes, there is much more to a person than seems at first."


You halt and inspect the broken assistant device. This glitch goes way too far.


And why does her voice sound so familiar!? 


You keep contemplating about it as you walk away from the monolith.
