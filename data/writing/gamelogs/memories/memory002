Memory of meeting Mary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind raises in the star-sprinkled darkness, and the whispers surround you again. You listen intently, eager to perceive every detail.


Another vision engulfs you.


It was the day you first met Mary. The Archaeological Institute of Vera had chartered your ship for an expedition to a distant excavation site. The flight was long and eventless. You found Mary in the lounge. She looked at the stars through a porthole. You accosted her, asked about her subject, the xenoarchaeology. 


<font:speech> "Is it worth it," <font:narration> you wondered, <font:speech> "to spent so much resources for things that were long gone." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Archaeology is not only about the past," <font:narration> Mary argued. <font:speech> "It is also about predicting the future." <font:narration>


Feeling a sudden urge to impress her with your cleverness, you mentioned that with astrology there was already a science that dealt with prediction of the future. 


Mary smiled at the joke and your heart jumped.


...



There is this cry again. You try to ignore it but it keeps distracting you, a steady sound in your mind. 


The vision fades. Mary's face blurs and you wake up.


...



Alisa drawls the words deliberately: <font:speech> "So cute, both of you." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Very funny," <font:narration> you snarl. <font:speech> "Anyway, how do you know what the vision was about?" <font:narration>


There is a silent pause. Very unusual for Alisa.


<font:speech> "I just felt it, like you did," <font:narration> she says finally. 


You do not buy it.


<font:speech> "How come? Those memories are mine. The monoliths trigger them. I hallucinate. It is in my head. You cannot 'feel' what is in my head!" <font:narration>


Alisa's answer sounds a bit irritated:


<font:speech> "Don't ask me! I really don't know how it works." <font:narration>


You check the device on your wrist.


<font:speech> "By the way, I have a news for you. You cannot 'feel' anything. You are a machine." <font:narration>


She laughs awkwardly. 


<font:speech> "Do not judge others based on their appearance, dear. Sometimes, there is much more to a person than it seems at first." <font:narration>


You look at the broken assistant device and frown. This glitch goes way too far.


Why does her voice sound so familiar!?


You keep thinking about it as you walk away from the monolith.
