Memory of the stargazing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another vision. Stars. Wind within the darkness. Voices within the wind.


You remember the night. Pure, undistorted darkness. Uncharted stars shining over your heads. Dump grass. Mary's head on your shoulder. Warm breath. Her voice, sounding clear among the monolith's whispers as she explains something you don't fully understand and don't fully agree with. But you don't mind. You smile. You remember the night. It could've last forever.


It's over too soon. Something blocks the vision. You here the cry again. Mary's face fades and you are back again, standing still in front of a monolith on the surface of an abandoned planet. Seven years older. Uncertain of your goal. Alone.


Not alone.


Alisa breaks the silence in her usual manner. "That's the lady we are searching for, right?"


You don't answer, holding at the rests of the memory, sucking them in. But Alisa can't be ignored that easily.


"Do you want to tell me about her?" she demands.


You shrug. "There is not much to tell. We broke up years ago."


Alisa gives you a precious minute of silence, processing your message. As she asks the next question, you can swear it has a note of sadness in it.


"The memory meant a lot to you. You must have really loved her."


You laugh cheerless and kick a stone away. "I still do."
