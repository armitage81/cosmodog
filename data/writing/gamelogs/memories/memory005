Memory of the stargazing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another vision. 


Stars. Wind in the void. Voices carried by the wind.


You remember the night.



<font:memory> Pure, undistorted darkness. Uncharted stars twinkling over your heads. Damp grass.
Mary's head on your shoulder. Her warm breath... 


Her voice echoes through the whispers of the monolith, clear and distinct as she tells you about her work.


You hope this memory lasts forever.



<font:narration> But it does not.


There is that cry again.


Mary's face fades and you come to yourself, standing still in front of a monolith on the surface of an abandoned planet. 


Seven years older. 


Uncertain. Lost. Alone.



No, not alone.


Alisa is with you.


<font:speech> "Why are you doing it, Karl? All this quest of yours. What for? Do you want to reunite with Mary?" <font:narration>


You do not answer, holding tightly to the fading fragments of the memory.
But Alisa can't be ignored that easily.


<font:speech> "Tell me more about her," <font:narration> she requests.


You shrug. 


<font:speech> "There is not much to tell. We broke up years ago." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "The memory was precious to you. You must have truly loved her." <font:narration>


A hollow laugh escapes you, empty and joyless.


<font:speech> "I still do." <font:narration>
