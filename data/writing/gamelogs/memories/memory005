Memory of the stargazing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another vision. 


Stars. Wind within the void. Voices within the wind.


You remember the night. Pure, undistorted darkness. Uncharted stars shining over your heads. Dump grass. Mary's head on your shoulder. Her warm breath... 


You hear her voice again within the whispers of the monolith. It sounds clear as she tells you about her theories. 


Like on that starry night, you do not fully understand what she says and do not fully agree with it. But it is okay. You smile. You want the memory to last forever.


...



But something is blocking your vision. 


That cry again!


Mary's face fades and you come to yourself, standing still in front of a monolith on the surface of an abandoned planet. 


Seven years older. 


Uncertain of your goal. 


Alone.


...



Not alone.


Alisa breaks the silence in her usual manner. <font:speech> "That's the lady we are searching for, right?" <font:narration>


You do not answer, holding at the rests of the memory, sucking them in. But Alisa can't be ignored that easily.


<font:speech> "Do you want to tell me about her?" <font:narration> she asks.


You shrug. 


<font:speech> "There is not much to tell. We broke up years ago." <font:narration>


Alisa gives you a precious minute of silence, while processing your message. As she asks the next question, you can swear her voice has a note of sadness in it.


<font:speech> "The memory meant a lot to you. You must have really loved her." <font:narration>


You laugh without cheer. 


<font:speech> "I still do." <font:narration>
