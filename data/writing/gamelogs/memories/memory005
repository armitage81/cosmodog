Memory of the stargazing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another vision. 


Stars. Wind within the void. Voices within the wind.


You remember the night. Pure, undistorted darkness. Uncharted stars twinkling over your heads. Damp grass.
Mary's head on your shoulder. Her warm breath... 


You hear her voice within the whispers of the monolith. It sounds clear as she tells you about her work.


You hope the memory will last forever.


...



But it does not. 


There is that cry again!


Mary's face fades and you come to yourself, standing still in front of a monolith on the surface of an abandoned planet. 


Seven years older. 


Uncertain. Lost. Alone.


...



No, not alone.


Alisa breaks the silence in her usual manner. 
<font:speech> "That's the lady we are searching for, right?" <font:narration>


You do not answer, holding at the rests of the memory, sucking them in. But Alisa can't be ignored that easily.


<font:speech> "Do you want to tell me about your girlfriend?" <font:narration> she asks.


You shrug. 


<font:speech> "There is not much to tell. We broke up years ago." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "The memory meant a lot to you. You must have really loved her." <font:narration>


You laugh without cheer.


<font:speech> "I still do." <font:narration>
