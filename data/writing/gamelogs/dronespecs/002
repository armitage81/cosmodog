AMPV


The Advanced Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a heavy armored, all-terrain unit that is usually deployed to guard strategic positions.
This unit's detection radius is limited, but its robustness, speed and offensive strength compensate for it.


Armor type: Heavy

Weapon type: Double machine gun

Damage: 4

Chaussie type: Tracks (Can cross plain and rough terrain, no water)

Max Life: 30

Speed factor: 2


Weaknesses: 


The detection radius of the AMPV is limited, especially at night. 
If a unit detects an intruder, though, there is no outrunning it.
Weak enemies will be most likely destroyed unless they deploy rocket launchers or other heavy weapons.
