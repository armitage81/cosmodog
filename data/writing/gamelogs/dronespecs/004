Turret


Turrets are stationary units used for protection of strategic points. 
They are most useful in narrow aisles, mountain passes or tree copses.
A turret's armor is almost impervious for most weapons short of a rocket launcher.
It can take a great deal of damage before being destroyed and its own fire power is unmatched. 


Armor type: Fortified

Weapon type: Turret

Damage: 7

Chassis type: Stationary

Max Life: 50

Speed factor: 0


Weaknesses: 


There is no way to destroy a turret without being damaged but rocket launchers
can be used to take a turret down with one shot.
The biggest weakness of the unit is its stationary nature.
An intruder can ignore the turret and just pass by,
suffering some damage but still reaching the point of their interest.
