Artillery


The artillery unit is the most dangerous drone in our arsenal. 
Other than other units, the artillery can fire over a far distance,
hitting the intruders without exposing itself to their counterattacks.


Armor type: None

Weapon type: Grenades

Damage: 4

Chassis type: Wheels (Cannot cross rough terrain. Cannot swim.)

Artillery units are moving on wheels and hence cannot drive over grass, sand or snow.

Artillery units cannot attack adjacent targets. Enemies can use this blind spot got ambushes.
