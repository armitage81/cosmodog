Artillery


The artillery unit is the most dangerous drone in our arsenal. 
Other than any other unit, the artillery can fire over a far distance,
hitting the intruders without exposing itself to their counterattacks.
The utilization of this weapon should be considered wisely, as it can be inaccurate in choosing the targets.

Artillery units are moving on wheels and hence cannot drive over grass, sand or snow.

Artillery units cannot attack adjacent targets. This blind spot allows enemies ambushes.
