Artillery


The artillery unit is the most dangerous drone in our arsenal. 
Other than any other unit, the artillery can fire over a far distance, hitting the intruders without exposing itself to their counterattacks.
The utilization of this weapon should be considered wisely, as it can be inaccurate in choosing the targets.


Armor type: Medium

Weapon type: Rockets

Damage: 4

Chaussie type: Wheels (Cannot cross rough terrain)

Max Life: 25

Speed factor: 1


Weaknesses: 


Artilleries are moving on wheels and hence cannot drive over grass, sand or snow.

A well armored intruder could storm toward the unit, ignoring the damage taken by its rockets. 
As soon as they reach the unit, it can be destroyed relatively easily.
