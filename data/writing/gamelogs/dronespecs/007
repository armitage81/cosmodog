Hercules


The solar powered battle drone Hercules is a mighty weapon. Its innovative power generator uses the energy of Phaeton's sun to let it hover 50 centimeters over the ground. This results in very fast movement even in the rough terrain and leaves enough energy to power two deadly laser cannons. Hercules is equipped with highly advanced AI that can spot enemies from afar.


Being solar powered, Hercules cannot be deployed at night. Operators must make sure that the drone is returned to a secure base before nightfall.
