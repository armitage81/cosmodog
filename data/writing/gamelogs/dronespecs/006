Scout


Scouts are wheeled units that have a long (but narrowly angled) detection distance. 
They are fast and deadly but only lightly armored.
Scouts cannot be attacked from behind as their detectors spot enemies in the rear.


Armor type: light

Weapon type: Railgun

Damage: 9

Chaussie type: Wheels (Cannot cross rough terrain)

Max Life: 10

Speed factor: 2


Weaknesses: 


Scouts have big fuel tanks on both sides of the main unit, making the enemy detection in these directions impossible.
Mostly moving on the roads, scouts can be taken by surprise from the road side and be destroyed in one shot.
