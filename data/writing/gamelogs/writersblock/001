Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be my breakthrough!


After all those years working on soap operas and razor ads, I finally got a chance to write a script for a real blockbuster movie.


I will show them what I'm capable of. The story will be unforgettable and original. It is about a space archeologist in search of a sacred treasure. He is racing against the minions of an intergalactic evil empire that tries to get the treasure to conquer the world. 


The budget is stellar. The scenes are located on Earth and on Vera. The showdown will be filmed on Phaeton. The crew built up decorations for an ancient temple there. It is close to a real volcano. So authentic! Our hero, Montana James, will have to solve the final riddle there to avoid deadly traps and get hold on the treasure.


The machine for the riddle is already constructed. It's huge! 


Now, I just have to come up with the actual riddle text and its solution.


Piece of cake for a talented writer like me!
