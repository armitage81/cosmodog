Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be my breakthrough!


After all those years working on soap operas and shaving razor ads,
I finally got a chance to write a script for a real blockbuster movie.


I will show them all my true talent!


The plot is intricate and original.
It is about a space archeologist in search of a treasure.
His enemy - an intergalactic evil empire trying to get hold on the treasure to conquer the world.


The budget for the movie is stellar!
We are planning to film the showdown scene on Phaeton. It will play in an ancient temple near a volcano.
So authentic!
Will our protagonist - Montana James - be able to solve the final riddle and save the world?
Wait and see! No spoilers here.


The machine for the riddle is already constructed. It's huge! 


Now, I just have to come up with the actual riddle setup and its solution.


A piece of cake for a talented script writer!
