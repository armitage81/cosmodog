Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ferrison Cort is getting on my nerves. I never liked this guy. No talent at all. He just got lucky with those "Galactic Battles" and "Knife Walker" movies.

I wonder if he is patient enough to wait till the right letter appears. Can he even read?


I still need to come up with the PASSWORD PHRASE for the riddle. Which poem should I take as inspiration?


This volcanic area reminds me on Dante's Inferno.
