Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like this phrase with ABANDONING HOPE when entering. It is catchy.


The PASS PHRASE is decided on then. Told the crew to configure the riddle machine accordingly.


I should tell Cord to not forget the white spaces between the words. 


Or should I?
