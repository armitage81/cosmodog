Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!


I can't come up with a riddle text and its solution. Seems like I have a writing block.


It can't be that difficult. Come on!


The director is becoming impatient. And the actor, this arrogant Ferrison Cord, distracts me with his "solutions" for the riddle. As if he had a ounce of creativity in his stupid head. No, I will do it myself. I just need to come up with the PASSWORD for the riddle.


Maybe, some ancient God's name? Zeus? Poseidon? Iesus? (Or was it written with a J?). No, too short. It must be a complete sentense to fill up the most fields of the riddle machine.


I know! I will use some catchy phrase from a famous poem!
