Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We tested the riddle machine and Cord almost stepped on the wrong tile. This idiot! He tried to blame me, of course. Said that the test phrase contained a spelling error. As if I did not know how to spell "Leader Jacket"!


I will arrange the tiles with the letters in a way that white spaces are always adjacent to the save platforms.


We need something meaningful for the PASS PHRASE. Something important.


Here is a good piece from Dante's Inferno. Perhaps I can take something from it as the PASS PHRASE for the riddle.


Through me you pass into the city of woe:

Through me you pass into eternal pain:

Through me among the people lost for aye.


Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:

To rear me was the task of power divine,

Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.


Before me things create were none, save things

Eternal, and eternal I endure.

All hope abandon ye who enter here.
