HINTS: SURVIVAL TIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not rush. The game will not advance unless you make a turn. Think about your next step before executing it.


Do not waste collectible items such as rations, medkits and ammunition. Think twice before collecting a ration when your foor resource capacity is 90/100, for instance. You might need it much more on your way back.


Note down locations of items you might need later. Found a medkit but your health is full? Mark it. You can come back later to collect it when urgently needed.


Study enemies and weapon damage against them. You will find log entries describing enemy type statistics.


Backstab enemies. Most of them can be killed without being able to retaliate when you choose the right weapon.


Focus on finding important tools from the beginning on. Your first priority should be to find a way to cross water.


Do not waste ammunition. Example: A strong enemy can be killed in one shot by a weapon with rare ammunition. You see a medkit nearby. Your calculation tells you that you can kill the enemy with unarmed attack in multiple turns even if you lose most of your hit points in the process. Your choice should be to switch to the unarmed mode. After all, your health will be replenished by the medkit anyway and you save your rare ammunition.


Look out for secrets. There are 120 of them. Most contain valuable goodies.


Do not be afraid of death. You will be thrown back to the beginning of the game if you die, but you will keep all your collectibles, your knowledge and your progress. Just try again.
