HINTS: VEHICLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many cars in the game world. You can enter a car simply by running into it. Exit it with SHIFT + arrow buttons.


Cars have two advantages. First of all, they protect you from enemy attacks. Secondly, your food and water reserves do not deplete while moving in a car.


Cars are armored. You see the armor points of a car (while sitting in one) represented by the violet bar on the top left of the screen, directly under the hit points bar. All damage you take while in a car is redirected from your hit points to the armor points of the car. If the armor points drop to zero, the car will be destroyed and you are on your own again.


You can find armor plates throughout the game world. Each of them will permanently increase the armor points of each car you enter.


Cars cannot move on rough terrain.


Cars need fuel to move. While sitting in a car, you can see the yellow fuel bar on the top left of the screen, directly under the armor points bar. If fuel depletes completely, the car will not be able to move anymore. Look out for gas stations. Enter a gas station while in a car to refuel it. You can also enter a gas station on foot. In such a case, you will obtain a canister with fuel. Enter a car then to refuel it using the canister.


Fuel depletes slower when moving on roads.
