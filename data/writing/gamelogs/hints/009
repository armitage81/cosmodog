HINTS: MONOLITHS, SOFTWARE PARTS AND MAP PIECES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your goal is to collect the thirty three insights held by big red monoliths.
Collecting all insights will allow you to reach the last section of the game.
Monoliths have electricity fields around them. Don't step into these fields as they will damage you.
The fields disappear upon collecting the memory associated with the monolith.


At the beginning of the game you do not have any map.
You can find map pieces, however, which will reveal sections of the world.
There are 64 map pieces in total. Each of them reveals a section of the map.
You can inspect revealed map sections in the game menu. Press M to open the map.


There are sixteen software chips hidden in the game world.
Finding them all is optional, but it will help you to master the last section of the game.


There are no dead ends in the game.
You can collect all items, kill all enemies, read all game logs. Press P to check your progress.
