HINTS: HIT POINTS AND DAMAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your hit points are represented by the red bar in the top left of the screen. Enemy attacks, radiation and stepping on land mines deplete the hit points.


Different enemy types do different amounts of damage. Study them to guess your chances.


You can collect jars with the Soul Essence to permanently increase your maximum hit points. Those jars are usually well-hidden.


You also can find medkits. Each of them will refill your hit points.


You will die and move to the start position if your hit points drop to zero. Don't worry, though. You always can try again. Your progress and all your collectibles will be kept.
