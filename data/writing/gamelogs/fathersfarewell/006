Father's Farewell - Part 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


The desperate crowd finally succeeded to breach Cosmodrom's perimeter.
Sitting on the floor in my room, I hear the commotion outside.
Shots. Screams. I do not have much time left.
On the other hand, there is not much left for me to do besides finishing this last letter.


Placed on my lap is the drawing board you returned to me.
I'm staring at your finished painting.


There are angry people behind the wall. Someone kicks at my door from the outside.
I hear a muffled curse. The lock holds for the time being.


The painting shows a family, standing on a farm field under the blue sky.
What I mistook for the horns on the man's head is in fact the outline of a transparent space helmet.
In the background is a space ship, ready to launch.
The girl who faces the man has her arm stretched out.
There is something in her hand. It is not a part of the painting.
It is a dry flower glued to the board.


A daisy.


Under the painting is a writing.
It says: "Remember the treasure?
Now you need it more than me. You are the best pilot in the whole world. I love you, dad."


The intruder behind my door shoots at the lock. Two bullets pierce the door and whistle above my head.


I don't mind.


This is the best day of my life.


I love you, too, my butterfly.
Farewell.

Dad.
