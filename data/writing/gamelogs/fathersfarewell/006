Father's Farewell - Part 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Michelle,


I got it all wrong.


The desperate crowd finally succeeded to storm the cosmodrom. Sitting on the floor of my room, I hear the commotion outside. Shots. Screams. I do not have much time left. On the other hand, there is not much left for me to do. Just have to finish this last letter.


Placed on my lap is the drawing board you gave me back. I'm staring at the picture for two hours straight. You have finished the painting of the three persons.


There are angry people in the floor. Someone kicks at my door from the outside. I hear a muffled curse. The lock holds for the time being.


The family stands on a farm field under the blue sky. What I took for the horns on the man's head is in fact the outline of a transparent space helmet. Behind the man is a big rocket. The girl who faces him with the streched out arm holds something in her hand. It is a daisy.


Under the painting is a writing. It says: "I kept this most wonderful present for you. Now you need it more than me. You are the best pilot in the world. I love you, dad."


The man behind my door shoots at the lock. Two bullets pierce the door and whistle above my head.


I don't mind.


This is the best day of my life.


I love you.

Dad.
