Father's Farewell - Part 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


Yesterday, I got to see you for the first time after the divorce.
Five years had passed without you. How big you became! Eleven years old. A beautiful lady.


I gave you a drawing board as a present. I know you always liked to paint. You took it in silence.


You and your mom are accommodated in the refugee camp at Cosmodrom.
Your passes are fine. Just three more days until your transfer.
Then you will be safe. Your mom's family will take care of you both.


I will stay here when the cabin launches for the last time. Don't cry for me. I knew the risks when I took the job.


Love you.

Dad.
