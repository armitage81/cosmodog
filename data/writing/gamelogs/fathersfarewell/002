Father's Farewell - Part 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Michelle,


Yesterday, I got to see you for the first time after the divorce. Five years without you. How big you became! Eleven years old. A real lady.


I gave you an electronic drawing board as a present. I know you always liked to paint. You took it indifferently.


You and your mom are accomodated in the refugee camp within the bounds of the cosmodrom. Your passes are fine. You just have to wait for three more days for your shuttle flight. Then you will be safe. You can go to Galatea where your mom's family lives. They will take care of you.


I will stay here as my duty is. Don't worry about me. I knew the risks when I took the job.


Love you.

Dad.
