Father's Farewell - Part 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


Yesterday, I got to see you for the first time after the divorce.
Five years had passed without you. How big you became! Eleven years old. A beautiful lady.


I gave you a drawing board as a present, because I know you always liked to draw. You took it in silence.


You and your mom are accommodated here at the airport.
Your passes are fine. Just three more days till your transfer to the space port.
Then you will be safe. Your mom's family will take care of you both once you leave this planet.


I will stay here when the last plane takes off. Don't cry for me. I knew the risks when I took the job.


Love you.

Dad.
