Father's Farewell - Part 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Michelle,


One day you will read these lines. I am not the father you deserved and I'm aware your mom made sure you know that. Consider my notes a farewell letter.


In the 20th century, the whole world used to hold their breath whenever a rocket launch was initiated. The shuttle launches here at the cosmodrom, on the other hand, have no spectators outside of Phaeton. Not only because space travel became a trivial routine. Our launches are kept secret. The SUF does not want the world to know about the evacuation. 


As you know, the situation would be worth a breaking news on some interstellar broadcast channel. The whole colony is in panic. The highway between Lydport and the cosmodrom is jammed with traffic. People who were born and lived their whole life on this planet are fighting each other to get a seat in a shuttle. Everyone is aware of the pandemic. All have seen the mass suicides. They just want to leave.


Most of them won't.


The SUF are losing their power. They are weakened by Dream Weavers and cannot keep control. It is only a matter of days till the cosmodrom will be overtaken by the angry crowd.


As an operator, I managed to obtain two seats on one of the last shuttles for you and your mom.


Waiting for your arrival.


Love you.

Dad.
