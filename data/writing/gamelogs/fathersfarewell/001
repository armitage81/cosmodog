Father's Farewell - Part 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


I never was the world's best father and I'm aware your mom made sure you know that.
Still, one day you may want to read these last lines from your old man.


The airport is very busy nowadays. Planes take off almost every minute.
The Fleet keeps the flight routes secret. They don't want the world to know about the evacuation.
But the locals are aware, of course.


The situation is getting worse with every day ever since the epidemic started.
The highway between the capital and the airport is jammed with traffic.
People are panicking. Everyone wants to get off Phaeton.


Most of them won't leave the planet.


The Fleet is losing control. It is only a matter of days until the airport will be overtaken by the angry crowd.


Being a dispatcher, I managed to obtain two passes for one of the last flights. They are for you and your mom.


Waiting for your arrival. Praying you will make it in time.


Love you.

Dad.
