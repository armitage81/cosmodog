Father's Farewell - Part 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


I never was the world's best father and I'm aware your mom made sure you know that.
Still, one day you may want to read these last lines from your old man.


The space lift is very busy here at Cosmodrom. It goes up and down without a pause.
The Fleet keeps the launches secret. They don't want the world to know about the evacuation.
But the locals are aware, of course.


The situation is getting worse with every day ever since the epidemic started. People are panicking.
The highway between Lydport and Cosmodrom is jammed with traffic.
Friends and relatives are fighting each other over a seat in the lift.


Most of them won't leave the planet.


The Fleet is losing control. It is only a matter of days until Cosmodrom will be overtaken by the angry crowd.


As launch operator, I managed to obtain two passes for one of the last transfers. They are for you and your mom.


Waiting for your arrival. Praying you will make it in time.


Love you.

Dad.
