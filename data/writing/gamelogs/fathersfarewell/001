Father's Farewell - Part 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


I never was the world's best father and I'm aware your mom made sure you know that.
Still, one day you may want to read these last lines from your old man.


Here at the cosmodrom, a space shuttle departs to the orbit every 20 minutes.
The Fleet keeps the launches secret. They don't want the world to know about the evacuation.
But the locals are aware, of course.


The situation is getting worse with every day ever since the epidemic started. People are panicking.
The highway between Lydport and the cosmodrom is jammed with traffic.
Friends and relatives are fighting over a seat in a shuttle.


Most of them won't leave the planet.


The Fleet is losing control. It is only a matter of days until the cosmodrom will be overtaken by the angry crowd.


As launch operator, I managed to obtain two passes for one of the last shuttles. They are for you and your mom.


Waiting for your arrival. Praying you will make it in time.


Love you.

Dad.
