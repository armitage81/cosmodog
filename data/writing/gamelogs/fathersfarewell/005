Father's Farewell - Part 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


You used to tell your friends your dad was a pilot.
I never liked it. After all, I never was good enough to fly a ship.
If I would be, I would have left with you from this god forsaken planet.


But it's okay. Everyone has to do their duty.
My duty now is to help saving as many people as possible. Someone has to operate the launch pods, after all.
It was never my dream job, but it is the one I have. I plan to do it properly.


Your shuttle is about to launch.
I met you and your mom in the waiting hall to make sure everything goes smoothly.
It is the last flight.
People outside of the cosmodrom know it.
There were two more breaches.
We will not hold on much longer.
I'm glad that you are leaving this place.
At the same time, my heart bleeds when I think about your departure.


Before going to the boarding room, your mom shook my hand. She wept.
You stood there and let me hug you.
I could not read any emotion on your face.
You took the drawing board from your backpack and returned it to me, saying: "It is yours."


That's it. You never forgave me.


I'm sitting on a bench in the waiting room while writing these words.
Behind the window, your shuttle starts roaring. It will take you from me, forever.


Farewell, my dear butterfly.


I will always love you.

Dad.
