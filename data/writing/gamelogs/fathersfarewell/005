Father's Farewell - Part 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Michelle,


You used to tell your friends your dad was a pilot. I never liked it. After all, I was not good enough to fly a ship. If I would be, I would have left with you from this god forsaken planet. But it's okay. Everyone has to do his duty. I learned it on that fateful day. My duty now is to make sure that as many people as possilbe survive this catastrophe. It was never my dream job, but it is the one I have. I plan to do it properly.


Your shuttle is about to launch. I met you and your mom in the waiting hall to make sure everything goes smoothly. It is the last flight. People outside of the cosmodrom know it. There were two more breaches. We will not hold on much longer. I'm glad that you are leaving this place. At the same time, my heart bleeds when I think about your departure.


Before going to the boarding room, your mom shook my hand. She whipped. You stood there and let me hug you. I could not read anything on your face. You took the drawing board from your backpack and returned it to me, saying: "It is yours."


You have never forgiven me, have you?


I'm sitting on the bench in the waiting room while writing these words. Behind the window, your shuttle starts roaring. It will take you from me, forever.


Farewell, my dear.


I will always love you.

Dad.
