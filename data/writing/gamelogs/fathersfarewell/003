Father's Farewell - Part 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


There was an accident in the morning.
People broke through the perimeter of the cosmodrom.
Some of them had guns and knifes.
The garrison troops managed to push the crowd back, but there were casualties on both sides.
Christ, there were families with children. They were just desperate.


Afterwards I visited you at your place.
Just had to make sure you are all right.
It was awkward to meet your mom again.
She did not approve my visit but at least she has not thrown me out.


You haven't said a word.


There was an unfinished sketch on your drawing board.
An outline of two grown ups and a girl.
The man on the right had something resembling devil's horns on his head.
The girl stood close to her mother, facing the man, her arm stretched out as if to protect herself.


I understand. I deserve it.


Your flight is in two days.


Love you.

Dad.
