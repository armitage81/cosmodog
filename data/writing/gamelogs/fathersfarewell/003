Father's Farewell - Part 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Michelle,


There was an accident in the morning. People broke through the perimeter of the cosmodrom. Some of them had guns and knifes. The garrison troops managed to push the crowd back, but there were casualties on both sides. Christ, there were families with children. They are just desperate to escape.


Afterwards I visited you at your place. Just needed to make sure you are all right. It was awkward to meet your mom again. She did not approve my visit but at least she has not thrown me out. You did not talk much. There was an unfinished sketch on your drawing board. An outline of two grown ups and a child between them. The man on the right had something like horns on his head. The child stood close to its mother, facing the man, its arm streched out as if to protect itself.


I understand. I deserved it.


Your flight is in two days.


Love you.

Dad.
