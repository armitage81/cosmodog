Father's Farewell - Part 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Michelle,


I don't sleep much these days. The constant roaring from the engines of leaving shuttles is only one reason for this.


I am afraid.


Not of death. I have seen too much of it recently to fear it.


I am afraid of losing you forever. Of letting you go, unprotected. Of not being able to watch over you.


Last night I dreamt about our last day in Gasolinera. You will not remember it, after all, you were only six years old back then. We went to a farm, only two of us. It was a sunny summer day. We played hide and seek, drank from a brook and hiked through the fields. You painted the landscape. This picture now hangs on my wall. I plucked a daisy and gave it to you. You said that it was the most wonderful present you ever got. I laughed and playfully demanded it back. You shook your head and said that you would keep it for me.


When we got home in the evening, there was a letter with my test results from the pilot academy in the mail box. I had failed. It had been my third, last attempt. My dream of flying had been shuttered.


I drank. Argued with your mom. Screamed at her.


When i woke up the next morning, you had been gone.


Please forgive me.


Love you.

Dad.
