Father's Farewell - Part 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


I lie awake at night.
The constant roaring of the space lift engines is not the only reason for this.


I am afraid.


Not of death. I have seen too much of it to fear it.


I am afraid of losing you forever. Of letting you go, unprotected. Of not being able to watch over you.


I often think of our last happy day together, back in Gasolinera.
You won't remember it. After all, you were only six years old.
We went to a farm, only two of us. It was a sunny summer day. The sky was so blue.
We played hide-and-seek, drank water from a brook and hiked across the fields.
I plucked a daisy and gave it to you.
You took the flower and claimed it was a treasure.
I laughed and playfully demanded it back.
You shook your head and said that you would keep it for me.


When we got home in the evening, there was a letter from the pilot academy waiting for me.
I had failed. It had been my third, last attempt. My dream of flying was shuttered.


I drank. Argued with your mom. Screamed at her.


When i woke up the next morning, you both were gone. I have not seen you for five years since then.


Please forgive me.


Love you.

Dad.
