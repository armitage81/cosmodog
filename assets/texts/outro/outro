My studies of the universe all those years led me to a simple, terrifying truth:


There is no meaning in life.


I was born and I will die for no particular reason. Love and hope are worthless on the grand scale of the universe.


This is the objective truth I was chasing after my whole life.

I will reject the objectiveness! I will be me!


Subjectively, my ideals are sacred.


Subjectively, my love is immortal.

My members are weak, but I manage to lift the toy with my hands.
Suppressed memories flash through my mind -- stars, fresh grass, an arm under my head. The toy. The dog. What was his name?
