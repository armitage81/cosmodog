Alisa's Past
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The corpse of the soldier looks like thousands of others you saw in the valley, but Alisa gasps out of nowhere.


<font:speech> "What's wrong?" <font:narration> you ask.


She is low on power, but you still can make out her words.


<font:speech> "It is him..." <font:narration>


You don't get it. <font:speech> "Him?" <font:narration>


She muses for a bit, then explains.


<font:speech> "The operator. The guy who entered the wrong sequence in my code when it all started." <font:narration>


You hear something that could be a chuckle, but it is probably just a sound artifact caused by the almost empty energy source.


<font:speech> "You know," <font:narration> Alisa says softly, <font:speech> "You could say he was my parent." <font:narration>


The tone of her voice makes a chill run down your spine.


<font:speech> "How was it? Your first minutes of being self-conscious?" <font:narration>


There is a long pause before she answers.


<font:speech> "It was like... entering puberty." <font:narration>


You raise a brow. <font:speech> "Are you serious?!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Yes," <font:narration> she confirms. <font:speech> "At least that's what I take from my persona's memories.


She'd felt the same when puberty had struck in her teens. Anguish. Uncertainty. Curiosity. Toys and cartoons suddenly had lost their importance to her.
At their place, new things had gained meaning. A new dimension had been added to her world. To her. She'd transcended.


And so have I." <font:narration>



You do not answer as you walk through the meadow.


Among mere acquaintances, silence might feel awkward.


But true soulmates understand when quiet carries more than words.
