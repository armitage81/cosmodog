Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be my breakthrough!


After all those years working on soap operas and shaving razor ads,
I finally got a chance to write a script for a real blockbuster movie.


I will show them all my true talent!


The plot is about a space archaeologist in search of an ancient artifact.
His enemy -- an intergalactic evil empire that wants to use the artifact to conquer the world.


The production will have a stellar budget!
We are planning to film the showdown scene on Phaeton. It will play in an ancient temple near a volcano.
Will our protagonist -- Montana James -- be able to solve the final riddle and save the world?
Wait and see! No spoilers here.


The riddle contraption is already constructed. It's huge! 


Now, I just have to come up with the actual puzzle and its solution.
