Script Writer's Notes

We tested the riddle machine and Cord almost stepped on the wrong tile. 
Another take was lost to his stupidity. 
Just stay there and watch the adjacent tiles till the right letter appears, idiot!


Okay, back to the PASS PHRASE. It must be something important.


Here is a good piece from Dante's Inferno:



Through me you pass into the city of woe:

Through me you pass into eternal pain:

Through me among the people lost for aye.


Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:

To rear me was the task of power divine,

Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.


Before me things create were none, save things

Eternal, and eternal I endure.

All hope abandon ye who enter here.
