Script Writer's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like this phrase with ABANDONING HOPE when entering. It is catchy.


The PASS PHRASE is decided on. Told the crew to configure the riddle machine accordingly.
It has multiple empty platforms. Every word of the pass phrase leads to the next platform.
The letters are shifting, so sometimes the actor must wait for the right letter to appear, and sometimes it is necessary to backtrack to an already pressed letter.


Oh my God, Cord will never manage it.
