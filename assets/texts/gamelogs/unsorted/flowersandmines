Sergeant Fergusson's journal
-------------------------------------------------------
We have secured the area around the monolith with land mines and put danger signs around the meadow.


Drastic measures, I know, but we have to stop the epidemic at all costs.


This place gives me the creeps.
While setting up the mines, I could swear I heard singing and whispering around me.


Eerie.


The others heard it, too. But the singing was not the weirdest thing yet.


As we woke up today in the morning, ready to head back to Lydport, I went to check
on the minefield. When I looked at the area, I stopped in my tracks.


The whole field was red.


Flowers. They grew exactly at the places where we set up the mines.
