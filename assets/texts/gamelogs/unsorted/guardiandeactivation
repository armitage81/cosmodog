The Guardian Engineer's Note
-------------------------------------------------------
The access to the monolith research facility is strictly limited to Scholars only.


Normal key cards are insufficient to achieve the confidentiality of the research process.
Hence, we created the Guardian unit which will stop anyone but a Scholar.


A manual override is the only way to deactivate the Guardian.
The unit will be destroyed in the process.


Sixteen software chips are required to activate the manual override.
They are hidden throughout the valley.
Only I know their location. Place all sixteen chips into the terminal in this room to initiate the manual override.


Use the manual override only in an extreme emergency.
