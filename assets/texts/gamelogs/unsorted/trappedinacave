Hastily scribbled note
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh my god, they found us! 

The drone somehow managed to cross the river and is roaming around the entrance to the cave.
We set up a barricade but it won't stop the damn thing if it decides to break in.
There are only three of us here, all women.


I pray that the walker won't find us. Otherwise, we have to be ready.
