Hastily scribbled note
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh my God, we are detected!


The drone somehow managed to cross the river and is roaming around the entrance to the cave.
We set up a barricade but it won't be able to stop the walker if it decides to break in.
There are only three of us here, all women.


I pray that the drone won't find us. Otherwise, we have to be ready.
