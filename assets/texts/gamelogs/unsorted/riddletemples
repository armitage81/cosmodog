"Space" Article About the Menesian Religion
-------------------------------------------------------
Worshipping gods seems to be the attribute of every culture.
Temples are the most common architectural structures that archaeologists find across the universe.
All of them are different. Some are built underwater. Others have the form of towers.


But even among this variety, Menesian temples are quite distinct.
They are riddle rooms, full of intricate mechanisms, pressure plates and sliding doors.


We do not know much about their religion and their gods, but one thing is certain: Menesians believed
in the ritual of pilgrimage, an intellectual trial in which the pilgrim had to shift stones in the right order
to open the door and enter the sacred chamber.


According to Menesian wall writings, this trial was called "Soo-coh-Bun".
