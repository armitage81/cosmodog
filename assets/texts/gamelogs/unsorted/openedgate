Message to the SUF officer John Maier
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Maier, let the fence be fixed ASAP.
I don't want a goddamn pigrat to enter the base through the hole.


And find out who is responsible for the damage.
These cuts look to clean to be an accident.
I think someone uses the hole at night as a secret passage out of the base.


Sg. Jackson.


P.S.


And one other thing:
I don't remember your patrol route going near the monolith island.
So stop your tours.
I don't know why the monolith fascinates you so much, but the island is still off-limits.
