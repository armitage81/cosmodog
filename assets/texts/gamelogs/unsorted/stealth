A girl's voice message
------------------------------------------------------------
Sam! You won! I can't find you anywhere! I give up!


You will NOT believe what just happened! Guess what?!


I counted all the way to a hundred,
and then I opened my eyes and saw this GIGANTIC thing coming right at me!
It was like that big flying thing we saw with Daddy last Saturday.
He called it a "drone," which means there's no person inside, it just flies all by itself!


It came super fast through the tall, tall cornfield.


I ran and ran, but it just zoomed right after me, so, so fast!


It was so scary! I didn't know what to do!
I just kept running, but it got closer and closer and closer!


Then I tripped! And I fell down! My knee still hurts a little bit.


But then, the big thing stopped right when I fell!
It couldn't see me in the tall grass!
It just stood there, making a funny rattling noise.


I crawled super quiet between all the corn plants until it
went away and I couldn't see it anymore.


That was the best game of hide-and-seek EVER!
