Scrap Yard Worker's Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing scrap is a boring job. Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is solving puzzles.
When the postal helicopter drops the regular delivery, there are always puzzle magazines in it.


The problem is:
I solve all the puzzles within days and am bored for weeks afterwards until the next package is dropped.


Boredom feeds creativity. I heard about the Menesian religious trials and decided to reproduce one of them
myself. These temples are great puzzles, after all.


Instead of stone blocks, I use scrap containers. Car wrecks are the walls. A hydraulic press acts as the ritual portal.
I even simulated the sacred chamber by building the puzzle around one of those ancient monoliths.


It works perfectly. The only thing is...


I keep forgetting the solution.


So just for the case, here it is:


Move the middle block: North, West.

Move the top block: South, South.

Move the middle block again: West, South, South, North.

Now place both the top block and the middle block between the hedgehogs so that they all form one vertical line. Top block should be between the top and the middle hedgehogs, the middle block between the middle and the bottom hedgehog.

Move the bottom block twice to the North.

Move the top block to the middle pressure button.

Place the bottom block between the top and the middle hedgehog.

Finally, move the top block to the bottom pressure button, the middle block to the middle pressure button and the bottom block to the top pressure button.
