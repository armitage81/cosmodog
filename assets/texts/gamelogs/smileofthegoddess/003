Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today is the day of the tournament. I'm writing these words before the final duel.


In the morning, all the townspeople gathered around the arena, beneath the gaze of the Goddess's Pillar.


The boys' oiled bodies gleamed in the sun as they wrestled upon the sand.


One by one, the defeated left the ring.
Their heads hung low, yet I saw relief in their eyes.
The Goddess would not smile upon them. The Pillar would not claim their souls.


As I feared, my son has triumphed in every duel and now stands for the final fight.


His opponent will be Tarik.


Channan is restless with energy, his spirit alight with anticipation.
During the blessing of parents, he scarcely looked at me as I washed his wounds and offered his ceremonial
bowl of water.
His eyes searched for Saikka.


But Saikka did not come.
