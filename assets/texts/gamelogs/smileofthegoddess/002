Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarik is Channan's closest friend. They took their first steps together.


With age came rivalry.
I see how both watch Saikka.
Tarik is strong, yet he cannot match my son.
Saikka knows this as well and favours Channan.


The tournament draws near.
As in every year, the town stirs with excitement.
The boys train, eager for victory.
The Goddess waits upon Her red dais, Her face solemn and strange.
She watches the ritual unfold, waiting for the victor to claim the prize -- Her smile.


I must act.
