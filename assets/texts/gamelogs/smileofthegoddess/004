Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is over. One day, my son might read these words. He shall know that I regret nothing.
And neither does Saikka.


The final duel started.


Both boys took their places, and the fight began.


To the surprise of many, Channan's dominance failed to appear.
My son seemed distant, his strength dulled. The contest was even -- Tarik held his ground.


The rivals rolled upon the sand, muscles taut, locked in grips,
while the Goddess watched from atop Her Pillar.


The boys' groans were the only sound in the heavy silence of the crowd.
That was why all turned at once toward the sudden cry:


"Stand firm, Tarik!"


Tarik. Not Channan.


Channan faltered, disbelief in his eyes as he turned toward Saikka.


That single moment was enough -- Tarik seized his chance and hurled my son onto the sand.
The duel was over. Tarik had won.


Men are proud and blind. They strive for victory even when the prize is death.


The Goddess will smile upon Tarik and grant him the honor of approaching the Pillar, to bind his soul to it.


My son will live -- though burdened with shame and wounded pride.


But he will live.


And one day, when his spirit has ripened, he will read these words and forgive:
my bowl of water laced with bloodleaf, and Saikkaâ€™s distraction -- both the snares that saved his life.
