Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Men are stupid. They are driven by their pride and rage. Men are not able to think.


I am troubled. I lie restless at night and look at the sky until the bloodleaf potion takes effect and gifts me the grace of sleep.
The dreams do not provide a solution to my problem.


My only son's naming day was a week ago.
Channan is now fifteen cycles old. He is a proud boy.
Channan goes hunting with the older men and wants to marry Saikka, the elder's daughter.
He is the strongest young man in the whole town.
My son is determined to prove his worth in the yearly tournament and gain the honor of the Goddesses smile.


I have to prevent it.
