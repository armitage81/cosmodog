Reconstructed diary of a Menesian priestess
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Men are ruled by pride and anger. Clear thought escapes them.


I am troubled. At night I lie awake, staring at the sky until the bloodleaf potion grants me sleep.
Even in dreams, no answer comes.


My only son's naming day was a week ago.
Channan is now fifteen cycles old. He is proud and strong.
He hunts with the older men and speaks of marrying Saikka, the elder's daughter.
He seeks to prove himself in the yearly tournament and win the favor of the Goddess.


I cannot allow this.
