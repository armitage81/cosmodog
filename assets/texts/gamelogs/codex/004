Dream Weavers


Descendants of the original colonists on Phaeton and members of the elusive Cult of the Soul.


Dream Weavers believe that alien artefacts on Phaeton steal human souls.
Their sermons are met with skepticism and condescension by the modern colonists.


Often feared and avoided by the citizens of Lydport and Gazolinera,
Dream Weavers live in small camps and consume a drug called "The Soul Essence"
to counter negative effects of the alien artefacts.
