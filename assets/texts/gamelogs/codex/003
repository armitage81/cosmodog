Phaeton


Phaeton is an Earth-like planet that has been colonized by the Star Union ca. fifty years ago.


Initially founded on the continent of Lydia by "The Lucky Quarter" --
a group of hispanic prisoners in pursuit of freedom --
the small colony recently drew interest of Star Union researchers
thanks to the ruins of the native Menesian civilization and mysterious red monoliths of unknown origin.

Main settlements: Gazolinera, Lydport.
