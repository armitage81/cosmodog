Private Higgs' journal - entry 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moving block by block toward the main square. No one here.


They left recently.
We see fresh food displayed on the shop vitrines.
The wind whistles in the wet laundry hanging on the lines.
Some buildings are on fire.
There are traces of a fight but no bodies.


Johnson stopped talking.


Moves his lips as if repeating a mantra, stares at the ground.
Makes me nervous.


What the hell happened here?
