Private Higgs' journal - entry 8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear lord! Johnson shot himself.


We're missing twelve men.
The wind grows stronger.
It whistles and howls, more a call than wind.


The captured Dream Weavers shout to get our attention.
Point in the direction of the monolith.
Richards who guards them does not seem up to the task.
Just stands there, stares at the gray sky.
They could've escaped if they wanted.
But they just scream their warnings to us.


Unimportant.


They don't understand.


They don't want to know what it knows.


They don't want to feel the comfort it gives.
