Private Higgs' journal - entry 10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was alone.


The whispers grew louder.
I heard the voices calling me, promising comfort and solace.


The monolith's embrace felt wonderful.


Except...


I didn't want to give in.


The fight with the captain had woken something up in me.
I had enough of being manipulated all the time.
I'd followed orders my whole life.
It was time to take control.


I thought of Johnson.
He'd appeared weird, but he was the strongest of us all.
He'd taken his own decision.


I could do the same.


I loaded the gun, closed the eyes and thought of dad and Paola.
The wind tore at my skin.
I smiled and lifted the gun.
The metal felt cool on my temple.


The whispering got quieter. I was myself again. I was in control. Even if for the last moment of my life.



Something hit my arm.


The gun clicked on the ground.


I opened my eyes and saw the boy.


I jumped up to grab the gun but he kicked it away with surprising dexterity.


<font:speech> "No need for this," <font:narration> he said and presented his hand.
In it was a small glass jar with a murky fluid inside.


<font:speech> "There is another way out." <font:narration> he said and smiled.
<font:speech> "The Soul Essence. Become one of us." <font:narration>


The choice was simple. Some people are born to lead. And some are born to follow.


I follow Dream Weavers now.
