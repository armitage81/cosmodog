Private Higgs' journal - entry 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
My father was never happy with his only son.


Boring job. Ugly wife. No achievements. According to dad, I lack any hint of ambition.


He wasn't even impressed when they'd drawn me in for service on Phaeton.
Said only losers end up in the army.
At least, you will stay away from your wife for a while, he added.


I guess, he had a point.


Life here is not that bad.
There is hard work and some danger involved, but I like the order and the discipline.


We're on our way to Gasolinera, a settlement East of Lydport.
Contact to the town cut three days ago.
Captain suspects Dream Weavers.
Our company was sent out to investigate and restore order in the settlement.
This could become my first firefight.
We'll see.
I'm not the one taking decisions here.
