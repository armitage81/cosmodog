Private Higgs' journal - entry 9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Captain gave order to execute the captives.
I was chosen as part of the fire squad.
Five men who are still able to hold weapons.


The Dream Weavers got silent as we put them in line in the back of a shed.
Fear in their faces.
My counterpart stared at me with his green eyes on the ugly dirty face.
A boy.
Helpless and innocent.
Like Paola.


I did not pull the trigger when the order came. Shots were almost not audible in the wind.
The other Dream Weavers fell down but the boy stood still.


Captain approached me and slapped me in the face.
Shouted something at me but the wind swallowed his words.
He pulled my rifle.
I kept holding it.
The others just watched us with empty eyes, weapons down.


Captain threw me down to the ground.
We wrestled for the control of the weapon.
The boy started running.
Captain pulled his handgun and took aim.
I pushed him and the shot missed.


He roared and punched me in the face with the free hand.
I twisted the handgun in his wrist and pulled the trigger twice.


Crackling sounds. Muffled.
Captain fell on me like a sand sack.
I rolled him from me, stood up and looked around.


The soldiers slowly moved to the center of the square.


I was alone.
