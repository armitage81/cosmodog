HINTS: Racing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a car race challenge to be found in the world.
Master it to get a vehicle-related upgrade.


Stand on the starting line to begin the race.


Your goal is to reach the finish line in time, that is in 30 turns.


Collect time bonuses to increase the time you have left.


Automatic traffic barriers will impede your way.
Their opening and closing is timed and always happens in a cycle.
You can see the cycle durations on the signs attached to the barriers.
The first number indicates the opening phase duration, the second number the closing phase duration.
Depending on the phase of the barrier, one of the numbers will be alight and will decrease with every turn, indicating the remaining
time of the current phase.


Example: A traffic barrier with the rhythm 3/2 will be open for three turns, then closed for two turns, then open for three turns again and so on.
Its numbers will change in the following sequence: (3)/2, (2)/2, (1)/2, 3/(2) (barrier closes), 3/(1), (3)/2 (barrier opens), (2)/2, ...


All traffic barriers sequences will be reset when driving through a reset field.


Hints:


The shortest way is not always the optimal one.


Not all time bonuses are worth the detours.


Sometimes, it pays off to wait some rounds for a traffic barrier to open instead of taking a detour.


Barrier resets should be timed properly.


You can do something useful while waiting for a barrier to open.


There might be hidden shortcuts.


Follow the rhythm while driving. (This won't help you whatsoever, but it's fun.)
