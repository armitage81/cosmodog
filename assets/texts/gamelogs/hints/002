HINTS: HIT POINTS AND DAMAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your hit points are represented by the red bar in the top left of the screen.
Enemy attacks, radiation and stepping on land mines deplete your hit points.


Different enemy types inflict different amounts of damage. Study enemies to assess your chances.


You can collect jars with the Soul Essence to permanently increase your maximum hit points.
Those jars are usually well-hidden.


Medkits can be found across the game world.
Each of them will refill your hit points up to the maximum.


You will faint and be dragged back to the start position in case your hit points drop to zero.
Don't worry, though. You always can try again.
All the game progress will be kept.
