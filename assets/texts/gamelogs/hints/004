HINTS: VEHICLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many vehicles in the game world.
You can enter a vehicle simply by running into it. Exit it with SHIFT + arrow buttons.


Vehicles have two advantages.
First of all, they protect you from enemy attacks.
Secondly, your food and water reserves do not deplete while staying in a vehicle.
Also, your food and water reserves are refilled when you enter a vehicle.


Vehicles are armored.
You see the armor points of a vehicle (while sitting in one)
represented by the violet bar on the top left of the screen,
directly under the hit points bar.
All damage you take while in a vehicle is redirected
to the armor points of the vehicle.
If the armor points drop to zero,
the vehicle will be destroyed and you are on your own again.


You can find armor plates throughout the game world.
Each of them will permanently increase the armor points of each vehicle you enter.


Vehicles cannot move on rough terrain, such as grass, snow or rubble.


Vehicles need fuel to move.
While sitting in a vehicle, you can see the yellow fuel bar on the top left of the screen,
directly under the armor points bar.
If fuel depletes completely, the vehicle will not be able to move anymore.
Look out for gas stations. Enter a gas station while in a vehicle to refuel it.
You can also enter a gas station on foot.
In such a case, you will obtain a canister with fuel.
Enter a vehicle then to refuel it using the canister.
You can find additional fuel tanks in the game world.
Each fuel tank will permanently increase the fuel capacity of each vehicle you enter.


Fuel depletes slower when moving on roads.
