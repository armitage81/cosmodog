HINTS: Portals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will find a portal gun.
With it, you can create up to two portals on specific wall surfaces.
Having two portals allows you to teleport between them.


Press [SPACE] to create a portal. Enter a portal to exit through the other one.
You can only go through the portal if the other portal exists and the exit is not blocked.


Using portals, it is possible to maneuver yourself into a dead-end. Press the R key
to reset the portal room in such a case.


The portal gun can be used only in specific lab environments. Trying to shoot a portal
outside of these environments will not work. You will hear a sound indicating that
the portal gun is not working in such a case.


Jammer fields will destroy existing portals when stepped on.


Reflectors will change the direction of shots from the portal gun.


Bollards and containers will usually block shots from the portal gun, but some of them are made of glass and will not block the shot.
