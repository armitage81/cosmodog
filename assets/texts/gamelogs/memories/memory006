A cry for help
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The memory is of your grandmother.  It evokes warm and cozy feelings.



<font:memory> You are little.


Grandma reads you a book while you lie in bed, the cover pulled snugly up to your chin.


The story follows a group of explorers.
The adventurous and suspenseful plot unfolds on an island teeming with mysteries and dangers, a truly fascinating place.
But even more fascinating are the people who discovered this place.


They are smart and educated. They know many things. They have an answer to every question.
When you grow up, you want to become like them.


Grandma's voice vibrates, shifting its timbre repeatedly, growing louder and softer, fading and returning, enveloping you completely.
There are many voices now. They whirl around you, whisper in your ears.


You grew up, they say, yet you remain unlike those adventurers you once admired.
You do not know everything. You lack the knowledge and answers to all the questions.


But we do. We know everything. We are what you search for. What Mary searched for. We are the rapture. 
Allow us to show you. Join us.


They are right. You give in, reach for the whispers, ready to join them.



<font:narration> Except, there is the cry again. Its peculiar sound captures your focus.
A weep, thin and high-pitched. A sequence of soft mourning.
The cry stirs something deep within you, an irrational, primal urge...


You feel your body again, your head jerking left and right as if trying to break free from the vision.
The voices become quieter and disappear. 


The silent weep lingers in your ears, the final sound before you awaken, sprawled on the ground before the monolith.
