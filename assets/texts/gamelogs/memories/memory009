Memory of the neighbour girl
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This time, you recall the memory of the neighbor girl you had a crush on when you were twelve.
She always wore plaid dresses and had long blonde hair that shimmered in the morning sun.
You remember peeking at her through the window, concealed behind the curtains.


What was her name? You don't remember.


Even after the memory fades, the thought continues to trouble you.
How could you forget her name? 
That summer, you were infatuated with her, trailing her everywhere like a shadow.


<font:speech> "What was her name?" <font:narration> you mumble to yourself. 
<font:speech> "It was important to me." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "It was long ago," <font:narration> Alisa responses, musing.
<font:speech> "At least, you have ANYTHING to remember. Be glad about it, human." <font:narration> 


After a pause she asks: 
<font:speech> "Say, Karl, would you remember MY name if I'd ever be gone." <font:narration>


Well, she will be definitely hard to forget. 


<font:speech> "Of course, Eleanor," <font:narration> you reply.


<font:speech> "Very funny," <font:narration> snarls Alisa, 
but her voice sounds as if she had approved your answer.


You leave the monolith behind, contemplating. 
The empty spot in your memory stings like a sharp shard.
Then Alisa breaks the silence.


<font:speech> "Helen?" <font:narration> she asks.


You smack your forehead in sudden realization.


That was it!
