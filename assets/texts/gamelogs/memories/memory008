Corn flakes and apple jam
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<font:speech> "My god! It was disgusting!!!" <font:narration> 


Your last memory deeply upset Alisa.


<font:speech> "Now I know everything about you, Karl, you pig!" <font:narration>


You feel your face flush with embarrassment.


<font:speech> "I was thirteen, goddammit!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "That's your excuse!? I'm nauseated!" <font:narration>


You stand there, blushing, angry with Alisa. 
What right does she have to pry into your childhood? Those memories are yours alone!


On impulse, you unbuckle the assistant device and hurl it at the monolith.
Alisa's voice stops abruptly as the device hits its surface.
Instantly, you sense a feeling of regret... and something else.


Loneliness.


What if you damaged Alisa? What if she went silent forever? 


You dash to the place where the device landed and pick it up. 


<font:speech> "Alisa? Alisa! I'm sorry! Say something!" <font:narration>


The blank screen stares at you for a while, 
then Alisa replies in a weak voice: <font:speech> "I'm afraid, Karl... 
My mind is going... I can feel it..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Alisa, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..." <font:narration>


At once, you understand what she is doing. 
The realization leaves you annoyed and relieved at the same time.


<font:speech> "Stupid robobrain!" <font:narration>


She chuckles as you secure the device back onto your wrist.


<font:speech> "Got you! Come on, admit it, you were worried about me. You like me, Karl, admit it!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Not at all! You are a little annoying harpy. You just laughed at my childhood memory." <font:narration>


She lets out a disgusted grunt, her disdain unmistakable.


<font:speech> "But it was abominable! Who on Earth eats CORN FLAKES with APPLE JAM? It's gross!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I told you I was thirteen... and it was delicious!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You don't have much taste, do you?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I do have taste, okay?! So hold your tongue! Oh, wait, you don't have any!" <font:narration>


Alisa chuckles.


<font:speech> "Touch√©." <font:narration>


She pauses briefly before saying:


<font:speech> "I like you, too, Karl." <font:narration>
