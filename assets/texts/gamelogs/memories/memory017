The last star
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The memory is dark. 


Dad's funeral marks the low of your life. 


Three years after Mary's farewell note, you step on the clammy soil, holding an edge of the coffin, 
together with three SUF officers. Your father, a hero and a guide, was not invincible, after all. 
Illness succeeded where his enemies had failed. Father's death comes as a shock.


An even bigger shock, though, strikes you later this day, as you go through father's correspondence. 
Most of the professional messages are encrypted and marked as confidential, but some of his private conversations are readable.


What they contain is unbelievable. Negotiations with lawyers, angry accusations on the part of the bereaved, 
mentioning of certain incidents, templates for speeches written by ghostwriters. 
Your father's monument crumbles under the shiny facade with every read document. 
His heroism, built up in your mind for decades, crumbles under the weight of reality.
As every general, your father used to coerce soldiers to suicidal operations, 
ordered killings of enemies, commanded executions. And he made mistakes that cost human lives.
Some of them verged on war crimes.


The truth leaves a void in your soul where admiration once resided.
It is almost unbearable. You log off. The next day, you leave your home planet.


You will never return.



<font:speech> "A bad one, huh?" <font:narration> Alisa asks cautiously, noticing your dark mood. 
You hesitate to answer. 


<font:speech> "Must have been a hard time for you", <font:narration> she inquires.
<font:speech> "First Mary, then your father." <font:narration> 


She reads you like a book but you don't mind. 
After seven years of silence, it feels comforting to talk to someone who cares.


You search for words to describe your feelings.


<font:speech> "You know... One day the last star will burn out all its fuel and dim. 
The Universe will become completely dark. No light. No warmth. Nothing to look forward to. No direction and no purpose. No meaning. Only darkness."


<font:narration> You shake your head. 


<font:speech> "That's what I felt back then. Darkness. Everything I'd believed in vanished,
or turned out to be a mere optical illusion, a distorted reflection of something ugly and shapeless in the dimming light."
<font:narration> 


You halt and chuckle. <font:speech> "Any smart remarks?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Yes", <font:narration> Alisa agrees readily.

 
<font:speech> "What you want to say is that you are searching for this last star that still burns." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "It's not really..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "And this star is Mary," <font:narration> Alisa cuts in.


<font:speech> "I am not saying..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "You know what?" <font:narration> she interrupts again. 
<font:speech> "Even if all stars — the real ones or those in your soul — stopped shining, every single one... even then, not all would be lost.
I mean... You could just go and make a fire... 
Your own source of light and warmth. 
It is up to you. Right? And, maybe, you could even warm others with it..." <font:narration>


You smile as the darkness in your mood fades away.


<font:speech> "Thanks for the warm words, Alisa. That was really enlightening." <font:narration>


She ignores the puns. 


<font:speech> "No problem, dear. That's what friends are for." <font:narration>
