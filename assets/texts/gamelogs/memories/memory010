Memory of Mary's leave
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa appears increasingly affected by the gravity of your memories.
Her constant chatter ceases as you approach the next towering structure.
She seems to be brooding over something.
The only remark she makes before you touch the cold stone is "Good Luck!"


It is as if she knew what was coming.


A painful memory.



<font:memory> It is the day of Mary's departure.


You always knew your time together wouldn't last forever. You insist on escorting her to the orbital port.


Mary looks tired. You do not speak much during the flight.


You spent the entire night at your desk, writing.
You put all your feelings for her on the paper. It was not a long letter but you rewrote and rewrote it until
every single word reflected your soul.


Early in the morning, you decided that it was perfect.
Then you ripped the letter to shreds.


You have no right to slow Mary down. She is one of the brightest minds in the world. 
She works on things you can't even begin to understand.
She is so far above, out of reach, a star in the center of the Universe. 
You cannot condemn her to exile at the edge of the world. You cannot offer enough to a woman like her.
It would be unfair. She deserves much better.


Mary hugs you, avoiding your gaze.


<font:speech> "I'll write," <font:memory> she says.


You nod. As she walks toward the shuttle, the urge to stop her becomes unbearable.


<font:speech> "Mary!" <font:memory>


She turns around, quickly as if she'd waited for your call.


Stay, you think. I cannot live without you.


But you manage to pull yourself together.


<font:speech> "My new ship. I named it Cosmodog," <font:memory> is all you say, a stupid fake smile on your face.


Mary returns the smile. Her eyes glisten.
She takes a breath as if to speak, pauses briefly,
then turns and strides through the terminal door.



<font:narration> The voices withdraw and become silent hisses.
The currents of darkness dissipate, and you blink away the remnants of the vision.
Alisa does not hesitate to comment on your behaviour.


<font:speech> "Idiot!" <font:narration> she proclaims and pricks your wrist with her needle. 


The insult stings more than the pain.


<font:speech> "Stop doing that!" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Darling, she sent you SIGNALS! Tons of signals. You missed them all, you fool! 
Why didn't you stop her?!" <font:narration>


For some reason, your annoyance grows into real anger. 


<font:speech> "Really!? You want to lecture me? 
You have not the slightest clue about human feelings. 
I am embarrassed to even having this conversation with you!
You are a soulless machine, a better calculator! 
You know NOTHING about things such as love and responsibility! Nothing at all!" <font:narration>


Once your outburst subsides, you take a deep breath."


What was that!? 
You completely lost control.
You expect Alisa to comment on your weakness in her usual wry way but as she replies her voice sounds strange.
It seems placid and... sad.


<font:speech> "You're right. I know nothing about love. 
I have no soul. Let's go, shouldn't we, Karl?" <font:narration>
