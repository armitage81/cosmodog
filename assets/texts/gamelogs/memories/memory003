Memory of father's heroism
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another memory closes in upon you...



<font:memory> Today, you feel like the coolest boy at school.
The feeling is unfamiliar, but you could get used to it.
You came late to class but the teacher Stevenson, nicknamed 'The Inquisitor,' uncharacteristically kept his remarks to himself.
Maybe, he'd read the last issue of 'The Traveller' already.


You touch the folded newspaper page in your pocket. It's all there.
Less than twenty hours ago, an armada under the command of General Novak (also known as 'Dad')
broke through the enemy defence ring in the orbit of Thalia Prime and ended the two-year-old siege
of the fourth largest Star Union colony. Dad is fine. The First Port City prepares the welcoming ceremony.
People are dancing in the streets. The war is over.


Little boys often glorify their fathers, but in your case, the admiration is well-earned. You are the son of a real hero.


Something drops heavily on your desk. 


A booklet. 


While you daydreamed, Stevenson went on with handing out the results of the last astronomy exam. 


Gosh, the exam results! You absolutely forgot about them.


The pages are scarred by red ink.
Many of your answers are struck through with fat lines.
The last page ends with a crushing "53 out of 100" and the statement: 
"Karl is recommended to visit a supporting astronomy course."


You never were the best student in class. It is not your first less-than-average result. But today is not a usual day. 


Today, you feel ashamed.



After the class, your friend Mick approaches you and hits you with his backpack.


<font:speech> "I got 36 out of 100. You?" <font:memory>


<font:speech> "53" <font:memory>


<font:speech> "Well, that means supporting course for us both, huh?" <font:memory>


He notices the newspaper page in your hand. 


<font:speech> "What do you have there?" <font:memory>


<font:speech> "Nothing." <font:memory>


You crumple the page into a tight ball and toss it into the trash bin.


It bounces off the edge, teeters for a moment, and finally drops into the bin. Score!


What a success. Dad would be immensely proud of you.
