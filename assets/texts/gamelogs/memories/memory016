The cry
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is as usual. 


The gusting wind lashes against your skin as you touch the monolith.
You hear whispers. 
The darkness surrounds you. 


You see Mary. But can it really be her? 


Tears are dropping from Mary's cheeks. It feels wrong. Mary is the strongest person you ever met. 
Seeing her cry creates a dissonance that makes the vision lucid.
You wake up, open your eyes, and lean against the monolith's surface.


Alisa is surprised by your sudden return. 


<font:speech> "That was fast," <font:narration> she says. <font:speech> "What happened?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I don't know." <font:narration> 


You shake your head. 


<font:speech> "You know... Mary... Her mind is still here, I'm sure of it. But..." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "But what?" <font:narration>


<font:speech> "I cannot reach her. This cry. It prevents me from uniting with her." <font:narration>


Alisa pauses thoughtfully before saying:
<font:speech> "What if Mary herself doesn't want you to join her." <font:narration>


You remain silent, stung by Alisa's words. But what if she is right?
How can you expect Mary to wait for you after all those years? 
What do you hope for, man? What are you doing here?


You wearily rest your head in your hands.
