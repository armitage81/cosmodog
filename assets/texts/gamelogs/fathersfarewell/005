Father's Farewell - Part 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


When you were small, you used to call me a pilot. You knew my dream, after all.
In truth, I was not good enough to fly a space ship.


But it's okay. To each his own, as they say.
My duty now is to help saving as many people as possible. Someone has to dispatch all those flights, after all.
It was never my dream job, but it is the one I have. I plan to do it properly.


Your plane is about to take off.
I met you and your mom in front of the gate to make sure everything goes smoothly.
It is the last flight.
People outside the airport know it, too.
There were two more breaches.
We will not hold on much longer.
I'm glad that you are finally leaving this dangerous place.
At the same time, my heart bleeds when I think about your departure.


Before boarding, your mom shook my hand. She wept.
You stood there and let me hug you.
I could not read any emotion on your face.
You took the drawing board from your backpack and returned it to me, saying: "Please take it back."


That's it. You never forgave me.


I'm sitting on a bench in the waiting room while writing these words.
Behind the window, the engines start roaring. The plane will take you from me, forever.


Farewell, my dear butterfly.


I will always love you.

Dad.
