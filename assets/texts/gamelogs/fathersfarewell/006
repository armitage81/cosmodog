Father's Farewell - Part 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
My dear butterfly,


The desperate crowd finally succeeded to breach the perimeter of the airport.
Too late now, but they won't listen.
Sitting on the floor in my room, I hear the commotion outside.
Shots. Screams. I do not have much time left.
On the other hand, there is not much left to do besides finishing this last letter.


There are angry people behind the wall. Someone kicks at my door from the outside.
I hear a muffled curse. The lock holds for the time being.


Placed on my lap is the drawing board you returned to me.
I'm staring at your finished drawing...



The picture shows a family, standing on a farm field under the blue sky.
What I mistook for the horns on the man's head is in fact the outline of a transparent helmet.
In the background is a space ship, ready to launch.
The girl who faces the man has her arm stretched out. But not, as I thought, to protect herself.
There is something in her hand. It is not part of the drawing.
It is a dry flower that you have glued to the board.


A daisy.


A message is scribbled under the drawing.
It says: "Remember the treasure?
Now you need it more than me. You are the best pilot in the whole world. I love you, dad."


The intruder on the other side of the door shoots at the lock.
Two bullets pierce the door and whistle above my head.


Happiness and relief flood my heart.


I love you, too, my butterfly.


Farewell.

Dad.
