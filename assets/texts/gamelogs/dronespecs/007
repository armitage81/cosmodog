HERCULES


The solar-powered battle drone Hercules is a mighty weapon.
Its innovative generator uses the energy of Phaeton's sun to let it hover over the ground.
This results in very fast movement even in the rough terrain and leaves enough energy to power two
deadly laser cannons. Hercules is equipped with highly advanced AI that can spot enemies from afar.


Operators must make sure that the drone is returned to a secure base before nightfall.
