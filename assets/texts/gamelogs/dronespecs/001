Bot


The bot is the slowest unit in the SUF arsenal. It is mostly deployed for patrolling dense urban or forest areas. 
The bot unit is cheap but not very well-protected. Especially the back armor is weak.
If caught by surprise, the bot can be destroyed by a single handgun shot.

Its light armor makes the bot vulnerable against handguns. A hit from behind can completely destroy the unit.
