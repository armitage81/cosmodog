BOT


The bot is the slowest unit in the SUF arsenal. It is mostly deployed in urban and forest areas. 
The bot unit is cheap but not very well-protected. Especially the rear armor is weak.
If caught off-guard, the bot can be destroyed by a single handgun shot.

Its light armor makes the bot vulnerable against weapons. A single hit from behind can destroy the unit.
