SCOUT


Often refered to as "Glass Cannons", scouts are wheeled units that have a long (but narrowly angled) detection distance. 
They are fast and deadly but only lightly armored.
Scouts cannot be backstabbed as their detectors spot enemies in the rear.


Armor type: Light

Weapon type: Railgun

Damage dealt: 9

Chassis type: Wheels (Cannot cross rough terrain. Cannot swim.)

HP: 10

Speed: 2


Weaknesses: 


Scouts have big fuel tanks on both sides of the main unit, making the enemy detection in these directions impossible.
Mostly moving on the roads, scouts can be taken by surprise and destroyed in one shot if attacked from the side.
