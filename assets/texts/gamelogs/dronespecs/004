TURRET


Turrets are stationary units used for protection of strategic locations.
They are most useful in narrow aisles, mountain passes, and tree copses.
Turret's armor is almost impervious by most weapons.
Turrets can take a great deal of damage before being destroyed. Their own fire power is devastating.


Armor type: Fortified

Weapon type: Turret

Damage dealt: 7

Chassis type: Stationary

HP: 50

Speed: 0 (stationary)


Weaknesses: 


There is no way to destroy a turret without being damaged, but rocket launchers
can be used to take a turret down with one shot.
The biggest weakness of the unit is its stationary nature.
An intruder can ignore the turret and just pass by,
suffering some damage in the process, but still reaching the target.
