Nomad's chronicles - part 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The monolith changed the way we perceived the world.


Knowing nothing of its builders, we were humiliated by their potential.

Our science, philosophy and arts advanced in never seen proportions.
This cultural evolution verged on transcendence, with the monolith
being the beacon, the source of our enlightenment.
