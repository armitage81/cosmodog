M. Harper: Night at the excavation site
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Again, you hear Mary's voice. As it reaches you, a warm wave flows through your mind.
It is another lesson at the university. How long it has been!



<font:speech> "How would you describe reality?" <font:memory> Mary asks the class.
<font:speech> "With the language of Physics, using concepts like mass, energy or force?
I think they are not enough. I believe, the key to understanding the Universe is... Information.
In fact, information is the line that separates reality from fantasy.


Look out of the window. See that star over there?


Now move your eyes to that other one.


Well, your glance just crossed the distance of many light years in one single second, making its speed faster than the speed of light.


How is it possible? Have you violated the laws of Nature?


No, of course not. For Physics only works when information is transported.


Your interstellar journey has not transported any information from one star to another.
Hence, it was not real. An imagination.


Information is the key.


Its exchange is the restriction that allows reality to exist in the boundless world of dreams.


Our current understanding of Physics has outlived itself.
If we want to understand the Universe as a whole, we need a new, more powerful language to describe it.
Instead of measuring masses and energies, we should focus our observations exclusively on the exchange of information, 
for every process in our world is merely a special case of this exchange. 


It is time for a new science." <font:memory>



<font:narration> Alisa is impressed.


<font:speech> "Wow, she sounds like she knew what she was talking about.
If you had children, they would be smart AND beautiful...
<font:narration> She chuckles maliciously. <font:speech> And maybe had some of YOUR traits, too.
I don't know, tranquillity or chest hair, maybe." <font:narration>


<font:speech> "Shut up or I'll turn you off," <font:narration> you growl, still irritated with another failed attempt of a contact.


Alisa laughs cheerfully.


<font:speech> "Ok, cancel tranquillity." <font:narration>
