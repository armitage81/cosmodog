M. Harper: Transcendence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the last of Mary's memories. It is fragmented, unstructured. Mary is about to transcend.



<font:speech> "Alone on Phaeton.


The AI was a big help. Thanks to it, I can finally access the alien base. Reach my goal.


Wandering along a dusty road. A lot of time to think.


We talked much, me and the AI. About my investigation. About my life. What did I tell it?


Something about a freighter pilot with a dog toy.


What was his name?


What was the toy?


I believe I tried to forget.


Why did it seem hard?


I hear voices. Whispers.
They are communicating.
Explaining.
Directing." <font:narration>



<font:narration> Grinning dog.
Inscription on a spaceship -- his name. What was his name? <font:memory> Not important. Nothing is important anymore.
Subjective perceptions -- so small, so trivial. Emotions. Feelings. Thoughts of an individual.
A misguided person. Woman, torn apart by love and vision.


<font:narration> 'Warp Jump' high score. Shy smile on his face. <font:memory> She was happy.
<font:narration> A transparent helmet over the dog's ears. <font:memory> A slender person throwing her shadow on the soil of the forbidden valley.
Fatigue. Many have walked her path, on this planet and thousands of others. Many followed the attraction of the field.
<font:narration> Thunderstorm. Wet, shining pages. <font:memory> Discoveries that led her here.


She climbs the hillside.
Trembling hands. Eyes scanning the horizon.
<font:narration> Stars shining on the pitch-black night. Taste of fresh grass. His arm under my head. Moment of happiness.
The dog. He had a funny name. <font:memory> But not important. Not important.


She falls. Stands up. Falls again. <font:narration> What was the dog's name? <font:memory>
Irrelevant. She is almost with us now.
Her body is slowly rolling down the hill.
She dashes through the field from one edge of the universe to the other and then back again.


The body comes to a hold. Looks at the stars. Looks through them.
Lips whispering words that have no meaning anymore. <font:narration> The dog... The ship... <font:memory>
Fingers clasping the grass.


She has joined us. The first one since centuries.


Many others will follow, now that she sparked the next wave of the Unification.
