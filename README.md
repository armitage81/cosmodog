# cosmodog

A turn-based 2D adventure game based on exploration, character improvement and narrative.

You are the pilot of the space cargo ship "Cosmodog". In search of alien life forms you tried to land on an off-limit planet 
hosting mysterious monolyths which are older than any human settlement in the sector. After an unmanned security
satellite hit the "Cosmodog" with a missile, you crashed on the planet surface in an emergency capsule. 

You will need to explore the abandoned valley to survive and reveal the ancient secret of the alien artifacts. Your enemies are 
thirst and hunger as well as the hostile security drones patrolling the forbidden zone and the only help is a personal assistant 
on your wrist whose A.I. Alisa established an identity crisis after it was damaged in the accident.
