 * There are currently three concrete subtypes of attack action phases:
 * PlayerAttackActionPhase, DefaultAttackActionPhase and ArtilleryAttackActionPhase.
 * The two latter ones are subclasses of the abstract class EnemyAttackActionPhase.
 * <p>
 * The raison d'Ãªtre of this class is to provide a common way to hold the fight action result
 * regardless of the action phase subtype.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class extends AbstractFightActionPhase which is a subclass of FixedLengthAsyncAction.
 * AbstractFightActionPhase holds all fight action phases, not only the attacks.
