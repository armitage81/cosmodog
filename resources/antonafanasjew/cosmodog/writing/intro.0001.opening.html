			You are the pilot of a space cargo ship.
			<p/>
			Its official identifier is CT245-M2, but you prefer to call it <span class="STAMP_IMPORTANTTERM">the Cosmodog.</span> 
			<p/>
			It's a long story.
			<hr/>
			You are similar, you and the Cosmodog.
			<hr/>
			You both are not the youngest and not the coolest ones of your class, but you are reliable.
			<p/>
			You are getting the job done.
			<p/>			 
			Since years, you are part of a little team performing The Search.
			<p/>
			It started long ago, when Mary contacted you in a dusty bar in Brazilia.
			<p/>
			She needed a pilot with a ship. Main quality for the job - cheap price.
			<p/>
			You had a busy month behind you, but you could not say no to this woman.
			<hr/>
			She introduced you to her team but of course she did not tell you about the Search.
			<p/>
			In her eyes, you were just a pilot.
			<hr/>
			Your involvement started years later when you became friends with Mary.
			<p/>
			Friends and nothing more.
