		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Suddenly, your portable computer comes to life.
			<hr/>
			When you hear the sound of the starting system on your wrist you are glad for a moment, but then comes a surprise.
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:???;">
			<span class="STAMP">Oh!</span><span class="STAMP">My!</span><span class="STAMP">God!</span>
			<p />
			I feel like having a monstrous hangover. What the hell has happened?
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You don't know what strikes you more - your computer's sudden casual tone or its voice which has changed from the usual metallic monotone assistant's timbre to a smoky female east-european accent.
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			<span class="UNSURE">Luke?</span>Are you all right?
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You knock on the screen but it remains dark. A spider web of thin scratches spreads from its center. Luke is damaged and its only remaining function seems to be the voice. And even this is not working properly.
			<p />
			You sigh.
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			<span class="SARCASTIC">Well, that's just perfect.</span>
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:???;">
			<span class="UNSURE">I...</span>guess, I'm all right.<span class="UNSURE">I just...</span>need to sort my thoughts.
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			This voice could be a drunk stripper's.
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:???;">
			What happened?
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			We crashed.
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Who is supposed to be of assistance here?
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			You are damaged.
			<p />
			Give me your status.
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:???;">
			<span class="UNSURE">Well</span>name's Alisa.
			<p />
			I'm a personal assistant, all right.
			<p />
			Built 2115 in Lugovoe near St. Petersburg. Not the newest model, you know, but still fresh and shiny.
			<p />
			What about you?
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			What about me?
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			you squeeze a thin-lipped smile
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			Listen,<span class="UNSURE">errr,</span>Alice, I would tell you my damn life story but I'm in a big trouble right now. You know, this type of a Robinson Crusoe situation. Let it be first things first, ok? I'll try to find a way not to die in the next couple of hours and then we will have a talk about your sudden reincarnation.
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			It's<span class="STAMP">Alisa!</span>
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You could swear, you heard an offended note in her voice.
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			With long<span class="LONG">iiiiih</span>and long<span class="LONG">aaaaah.</span><span class="LONG">Aliiiisaaah.</span>
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Her accent sharpens as she spits out next words
			<p />
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			<span class="STAMP">As you please!</span>I'm not into talking right now, anyway. My head is gonna burst!
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You whisper a curse.
			<p /> 
			A broken, moody transvestite computer personality - exactly the thing you need right now.
			<p />
			You make a movement to remove the damaged assistent from your wrist but then you stop.
			<hr/>
			Even in this condition, the computer could be useful in your situation.
			<p />
			With a sigh you continue your journey.
