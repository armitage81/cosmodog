		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Listen!
			<hr/>
		</div>


		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Alisa's sudden voice gives you the creeps. You realize that you didn't hear anything but your steps and calls of some distant birds for a long time.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			What's wrong? I don't hear anything.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			That's exactly what I mean, dummy!
			<p/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			It's just your broken assistant speaking, but for a second you imagine a young lady rolling her eyes in view of your stupidity.
			<p/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Where is everyone, if I may ask?
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You look at the sharp edges of the mountains around you.
			<p/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			I don't know. The planet is off-limits. Perhaps, it's not inhabited.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			And who has built this road? Indigenous creatures? Giant worms, maybe? Or some other strange life forms?
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			Said a broken robot lady.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			You are a meanie, darling, but I forgive you.
			<p/>
			What are we doing here, by the way?
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			This thing is too emotional and too curious for her own good.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			We are searching something.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Searching what?
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			If you knew. 
			<p/>
			For a moment, you see Mary's face - not her usual pretty features, but a retarded mask with empty eyes and half-opened mouth, staring mindlessly at the pink toy dog in front of her.
			<p/>
			You blink the picture away.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			The road must get me... us somewhere. We should move on.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Well, yes. Let's go.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Alisa sighs. What the hell! You didn't even know, such thing was possible for a portable assistant device.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			And while you walk, my dear, I'll drown my sorrows in the blissful ignorance.
			<p/>
		</div>
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You almost feel sorry for her.
			<p/>
			Almost.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			Just call me Carl.
			<hr/>
		</div>
