		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Your eye catches a blinking green light and as you turn your head you see an item of a familiar structure nearby.
			<hr/>
		</div>


		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
		Hey, what do we have here!?
		<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You run towards the flashing signal light.
			<p/>
			Alisa's gyroscope wakes her up from the cyber slumber.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			May I ask what makes you so exited, my dear? In my humble opinion we are in a huge heap of dang at the moment.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You ignore her and pick up the little ceramic box. 
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			You don't need to answer me, darling, but it would be easier for both of us if you'd cooperate.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Alisa seems to suffer from the lack of attention.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			An emergency food ration. It must have fallen from the capsule module after it was hit by the missile. 
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You open one tube and swallow its contents.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			That's good, that's good. How does it taste?
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			As if you would understand...
			<hr/>
			It's disgusting.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You were never a big fan of synthetic food, but these tubes and conserves could save your life. 
			<p/>
			Unfortunately, the rations seem to be scattered around the landscape and this one will suffice for only one meal. You'll need to find more if you want to survive.
