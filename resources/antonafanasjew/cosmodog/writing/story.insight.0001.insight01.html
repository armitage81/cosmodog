The red thing looks unnatural and out of place. It's not really visible, but you still can observe its clean geometrical shape without seing it with your eyes. 
			<p/>
Without a second thought, you touch the thing. At the same moment, a vague memento is rising in your mind. 
			<hr/>
It hurts. You try to fight it back, hide it under the stack of the passed years, but it's there, undeniable, fresh, real.
			<hr/>
You struggle until you are out of mental strength and, finally, you give in and face your memory.
			<hr/>
...

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
Today, you are the proudest boy in the school. Not Elias, the swimming recordsman. Not Paul, who owns the complete Space Reptiles cards collection. Not the handsome chic-magnet Cirk. You.
<hr/>
The feeling is unfamiliar, but you could get used to it.
<hr/>
The exciting news let you forget the time. You came late to class and risked a serious preaching session with the old astronomer Stivensson. Surprisingly, the wrinkled inquisitor just nodded you in and continued talking about La Grange points. Perhaps, he saw today's issue of the Traveller already.
<hr/>
You clutch the folded newspaper page in your pocket and turn around to see your friends. The studious Jose is noting down each word of the inquisitor, as always. He doesn't seem to have noticed you at all. Mick gives you an ironic glance and an amused smirk. You show him the news paper from far, but he just shrugs his shoulders. They do not now yet. You'll have to wait till the end of the class.
<hr/>
Boys tend to see their dads as heroes. In your case, it's an objective truth. Less than 20 hours ago, an armada under the command of Martin Honda (also known as Dad) broke through the blockade in the orbit of Thalia Prime and ended the two-year-old siege of the fourth biggest federation colony. 
<hr/>
That's all in the newspaper. The Preservers are fleeing in panic. Dad's fine. First Port is preparing the welcoming ceremony. People are dancing in the streets.
<hr/>
And you have to kill two hours before you can talk to the boys. You imagine their faces and try to hold back the smile. 
<hr/>
You almost jump out of your skin as suddenly something snaps on your table. A booklet. While you were daydreaming, the inquisitor snuck up on you and started to hand out the results of the last astronomy exam. Gosh, the exam! You absolutely forgot about it.
<hr/>
There is more red than black ink on the last pages. Many of your unsure answers are struck through with even lines which are fat and firm as if inquisitor Stivensson has dealt them in anger and rage. He also hasn't spare you the comments. "Nonsense", "Not at all" and "Wrong, wrong, wrong!" are only some of the inquisitors remarks. The correction orgy is summarized by a crushing "53 out of 100" and the statement "Carl is recommended to visit a supporting astronomy course."
<hr/>
You never have been the best student in class. It is not your first less-than-average result. But today is not a usual day. You look at the red ink and feel burning shame rising in your heart. There is a sudden imagination that all the other students are looking at you and shaking their heads. You hide your face and try to fight back the tears.
<hr/>
After the class, your friends approach you and Mick hits you with his backpack.

You have to tell me how you managed to avoid the wrath of the inquisitor, man! You've definitely got talent!
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
You put on a smile. 
			<p/>
		</div>		
		
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
It was mere luck, nothing special.
			<hr/>
		</div>	
		
		<div style="speaker:mick;speakerLabel:Mick;">
Speaking of nothing special. I got 36 out of 100. You?
			<hr/>
		</div>
		
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
53
			<hr/>
		</div>	
		
		<div style="speaker:mick;speakerLabel:Mick;">
Well, that means supporting course time again for us both, he? At least, we can get rid of the wise guy here.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
Mick pushes Jose and laughs, then remembers something.
			<p/>
		</div>	
		
		<div style="speaker:mick;speakerLabel:Mick;">
By the way, what was it you were waving around in class? Want to tell us something?
			<hr/>
		</div>
		
		
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
You feel how your face turns red and look down.
			<p/>
		</div>		
		
		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
No. Nothing at all.
			<hr/>
		</div>	
		
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
You throw the paper ball towards the trash bean. It jumps off the edge, hits it again, dances on it for a second and finally tilts down and falls into the bin. Score!
			<hr/>
		</div>	

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
What a success. 
			<p/>
Dad would be proud of you.
