			You crawl out of the damaged lander - pulling your emergency backpack behind you. It comes as a shock, but you are not injured.
			<hr />
			Your survival was a lucky coincidence. The lander crashed in a narrow valley surrounded by tooth sharp edges of rocky mountains. Hundred meters more or less and you would have been pulverized beyond recognition.
			<hr />
			You fall on the ground trying to normalize your pulse. While your body is still busy remixing the hormones, the brain is already starting analyzing the situation. What do you have on the good side? You are still breathing and you reached your destination planet. On the bad side - you are an intruder on an off-limits zone without a ship or any means to travel with supplies for the next couple of days.
			<hr />
			You decide to focus on the good side.
			<p />
			Then you stand up.
