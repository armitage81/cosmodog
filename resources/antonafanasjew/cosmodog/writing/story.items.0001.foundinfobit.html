		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			That's strange!
			<p/> 
			You could swear, you just saw a little transparent reddish
			pyramide floating in the air ten meters in front of you.
			<p/>
			No - it is not really visible, you just FEEL its presence nearby.
			<p/>
			It's like a knowledge of something - projected on an imaginary geometric
			figure.
			<hr/>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			What the...
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Your first urge is to walk away, but somehow you feel an attraction
			towards the invisible red thing.
			<p/>
			You slowly walk to its location and stretch out your arm touching the
			intangible edge of the pyramide.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Then, something happens.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You can't explain it.
			<p/>
			It feels like having lost ones physical properties for a moment. As if
			the whole universe would slightly shift and then jump back again. In
			this one moment you can smell colors and touch thoughts.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			A second later, you feel your weight again and hear the frequent
			rhythm of your heart.
			<p/>
			The invisible pyramide presence has disappeared.
			<p/>
			The world is still there and nothing has changed.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			No, that's not true.
			<p/>
			There was a change.
			<p/>
			You KNOW something now.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			It feels like a new focus in the far corner of your mind on something
			that you always knew.
			<p/>
			It's like realizing the presence of the TV through the sudden silence
			after it was switched off.
			<p/>
			You have learned something important.
			<p/>
			You have no idea what it was.
