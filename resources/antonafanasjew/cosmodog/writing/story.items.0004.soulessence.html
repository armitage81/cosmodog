<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
You pick up the big jar with a murky green fluid inside and examine it. 
<p/>
There is a label on the jar. It reads: "Soul Essence". The content behind the thick glass looks like some homebrewed medicine. 
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
Or poison.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
Alisa, I need an analysis on this fluid.
<p/>
</div>	

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">	
You open the bottle and remove the little lid covering your assistant's extendible analyzer tentacle.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
The tentacle doesn't come up.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
Which fluid?
<p/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">	
Alisa says it in a tone of someone who was asked to put a hand into a bee hive.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
How can I say? That's why I need you to analyze it!
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
I'm not sure if it is a good idea, honey. I HATE water.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
You can't believe your ears.
<p/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
Come on! That's what you were designed for! Just take a probe and tell me what it is! What could go wrong?
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
There's... no need for this. I... I can tell you about it just like this.
<p/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
She activates her scanner and measures the bottle for a moment.
<p/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
Yep, yep, usual medicine, no problem with it. Just keep it away from me.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
You can't be serious! How did you find out? Based on it's color?
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
Ever heard of female intuition?
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
She sighs. Why does she sigh? What is in it for a robot?
<p/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
Darling, please, don't force me to touch it. I already feel the rust corrupting my gentle parts.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
You're the most cowardly personal assistant ever!
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
So why don't YOU try it then?
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
I will if I have to!
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
Then just do it.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
I don't need a robot to tell me what to do!
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
Chicken!
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
Arrgh!
<hr/>
</div>


<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
In a flash, you jerk the cork open and make a sip.
<p/>
It feels like a combination of alcohol and a severe burn. You almost drop the bottle as you try to catch air, not able to cough or cry.
<p/>
In the next moment, the pain has gone and you feel an energizing flow driving through your body. You never felt so vital.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
It... it is some kind of a drug.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
Alisa seems to be amused.
<p/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
You're so easy to manipulate, my dear.
<hr/>
</div>

<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
I'm okay, no need to worry, thank you.
<hr/>
</div>


<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
You're not about to discard any means for survival.
<p/>
You finish off the medicine and feel as if you could shift a mountain.
<p/>
If there is more of this soul essence, you need to find it.
<hr/>
</div>
