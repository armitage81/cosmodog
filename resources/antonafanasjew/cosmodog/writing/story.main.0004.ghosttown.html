		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You breathe a sigh of relief as you see first signs of a human settlement.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			Finally, a town!
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			But your gladness doesn't last long. You examine the burnt building nearby and understand that the uneasy feeling of lonelyness still lingers in the atmosphere.

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			It's abandoned. What happened here?
			<hr/>
		</div>	


		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Alisa is glad to help.

			I register smoke and a little share of radiation in the air. This place was likely hit by bombs. How barbaric!

		</div>


		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You look at the rubble and ashes around you.

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			It must have happened not so long ago. Did we end up in a war zone? I don't see a single body. This place was evacuated completely before it started.

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			This gives me the creeps.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Indeed, you feel a motoric vibration from the computer on your wrist. Alisa is for sure a drama queen.
			<hr/>
		</div>


		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			Let's look around.
