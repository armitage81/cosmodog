		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			The landscape between the mountain chains is plain and so you see the vehicle on the road side from far, but you only recognize it as such as you approach it. 
			<hr/>
		</div>


		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You know wheeled vehicles from movies and they had a real one in a museum you visited once, but you never had a chance to see one in action. 
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			This one looks old and rusty. The tires are half flat. Both front lights are broken. The trunk and two of the doors are open wide as if the owners left the vehicle in a hurry. 
			<hr/>
		</div>
		
		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You look inside. The key is still in the console.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Alisa wakes up.			 
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Why did we stop, darling? Are you tired? Is it time for a break?
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You drop yourself on the front seat and try the controls.
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			I found an abandoned vehicle. A wheeled one. It seems to work.
			<hr/>
		</div>


		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Wow, you are taking me for a ride? It's so exciting!
			<p/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			Suddenly, she stumbles.
			<p/>
		</div>
		
		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Wait, can you drive it?
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:carl;speakerLabel:You;">
			I'm a pilot. Driving stuff is my job.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:alisa;speakerLabel:Alisa;">
			Famous last words.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			You turn the key and the engine starts with a vibrant sound. The car jerks forward causing some comments from Alisa, which are a mixture of sarcasm and honest fear, but the next moment you have it under control.
			<hr/>
		</div>

		<div style="speaker:narrator;speakerLabel:;">
			The journey will be slightly more comfortable from now on.
			<hr/>
		</div>
